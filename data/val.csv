train_pid_3424,"New Year’s : new year’s eve always sucks. i spent the last three days high and now that i’m sober everything feels like garbage again. my whole body’s sore cause i’ve been sleeping in a chair. i keep fighting with all my family members and it feels like everyone is constantly telling me that i’m wrong about everything i say. i feel stupid and sluggish and lazy and irritated.

I also go through phases of just really wanting friends/boyfriend/company and feeling really alone. Then that phase passes after a week or two and i feel like i just want to be alone and that i dont want or need anyone else. then the cycle repeats. i have no idea why. 

I’m still anxious and upset because my last post made me sound like im “making up mental illness for attention.” so now i’m overanalyzing everything i say to try not to come across that way. I hate feeling like this cause a lot of my family has accused me of being an attention whore whenever i talk about my insecurities. but talking about emotions is cathartic and healthy so i guess I shouldn’t let a couple negative people ruin this for me. I really don’t want to be misunderstood and I’m paranoid that people are gonna hate me no matter what i say. anyway.

On a positive note, i’ve decided to start up therapy again this semester. wish me luck. hope your new year’s was better than mine.",1
train_pid_2630,"I'm faking depression : My doctor and every other therapist and counsellor and psychiatrist I've been to since I was 13 (now 18) tells me I'm depressed, and that makes sense because I'm the textbook suicidally depressed person. And for a while I managed to believe that but I've realised that it's just been a giant excuse for me to be able to escape my responsibilities and not be accountable when I was an asshole towards others because ""oh but my depression :c""

It just doesn't add up to me. I've been in and out of hospital more times than I can count because I was *going* to kill myself but oh no, couldn't think of a way to do it in a way that was least harmful to everyone else so oopsies!! (this wasn't me, my doctor and my boyfriend have both stepped in to Make me go to hospital which i have hated but i guess part of me wants that attention and ""please admit me to the psych ward now i am big depression""). 

i am lazy and starved for attention and i find ways to get what i want by picking a random symptom of depression and amplifying it for sympathy. if I'm not doing that I'll take a random chest pain i felt 5 minutes ago and act like it's debilitating so i can lay in bed and watch Netflix and then realise i haven't been paying attention to the last 10 minutes and go back and let the same thing happen again. I've managed to get my high school to contact my state's education department to nullify basically half of my assessment material because I was routinely failing classes with an ""im depwessed :c"". if i was genuine i might have felt thankful but all i felt was guilt for effectively cheating my way into a high ranking

I've managed to trick myself into believing it's real and I'm actually struggling and on the surface it makes sense because no normal person faking depression makes themself spend upwards of 6 hours in a hospital waiting room nearly twice a month but the more i think about it the less sense it makes. I'm fine. I'm not depressed or anxious or whatever I've managed to convince myself and others i am. 

i think a combination of low self esteem and laziness has embarrassed me into putting a more ""respectable"" (for a serious lack of a better word) label on it and I've become addicted to being a victim. even writing this I'm sure I've spun it to seem depressed but trapped by that whole thing where you question yourself and i keep thinking myself in circles about it but I'm fairly certain this is the truth at this point.",1

train_pid_6503,"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",0

train_pid_282,"My family loves me, but I hate myself. : I have always been a smart, optimistic child. I was one of the best at my school. I always made everyone proud.
But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. 

After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. 

Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. 

After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. 
We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.

After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew. 


Tl;DR: Went to a party,  tipsy --&gt; fun, drunk --&gt; told all my secrets/insecurities to a girl. 

Made out/cuddled with her the whole night. 

Woke up --&gt; got depressed/antisocial/sober. 

Scared of contacting her cause of past trauma and insecurities.


Question: How do I go about contacting her, mind you I'm extremly awkward.

train_pid_3795,"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.

train_pid_1216,"I’ve begun to give up hope on doing anything well. I literally cannot do anything right anymore, cannot do anything well. 2020 is just going to be a reminder of how much time I’ve wasted. : Maybe this isn’t right to throw my thoughts out, but I just need to vent I think. With the new year of 2020 here, I honestly feel that I should be something more than I was excluding wisdom gained from aging. Growing up I was a huge gamer and I love games always have. I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don’t know if I’m depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. I told myself for the longest time, 2020 is gonna be my year, my strongest year yet, I’m a day in and I already feel like giving up. Pathetic right.",1

train_pid_7187,"please read : my new years resolution this year is to try to look for a ray of sun every day, and to help others see it, too. first, i’ve accepted that i’m not going to be able to be positive every day and reminding myself of my resolution might result in me getting even more pissed off that day, but i’m going to try every day.

i’ve also made a list of stuff for you to do to brighten your day :) you could:
-bake yourself something sweet
-have a dance party with yourself
-do a face mask
-reorganize your room
-watch a comedy

i understand that these things seem super basic and unhelpful, but some days doing anything more than this is nearly impossible.

something i’ve noticed that helps me is collecting things. it makes me notice things when i leave the house. i have a large collection of miniature things, a very small collection of antiques/vintages, i’ve collected 71 soda tabs (over 60 of them from la croix bottles), stuffed animals, and candles. it really does help.

i also made a short playlist of songs i like vibing too [here](https://soundcloud.com/nikki-ozeruga/sets/best-vibes/s-e0DuD)
don’t bully me for using soundcloud you can actually control the next song and there’s less ads 🥴",0

train_pid_3400,"Being single makes everything worse... : My whole life i’ve been alone. I’ve been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely  serious. As I grow older (I’m 24) all my friends are settled down with someone. Married, kids, engaged, long relationships.

I’ve always been single. And the sad part is, I don’t know what i do wrong. I’m a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. But i’ve suffered greatly from OCD and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak (my only justification). It’s almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. The cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend.

Over 24 years you have enough of feeling like you’re not good enough. Tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. Tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. I decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that EVERYone i know looks at me as the “always single and alone” guy. People even bring it up to me. It really hurts me deep down",1
train_pid_4626,"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life? 

I’ve been depressed most of my life. And for once I don’t want to get better. Because it just doesn’t make sense to be happy if everyone else around me isn’t.",1
train_pid_645,"Lonely New Year : So I don't know if this belongs here but I just need to...write a little? 
This is the first new year I spent completely alone because I am home sick. I could have gone to a friend who was partying with a lot of strangers(to me), but without alcohol I can't even tolerate that for 30 minutes.
So I am sitting at home, alone and I just feel empty again, like so often. It's like this physical black hole in my chest that sucks in all my energy. I have this very often, especially when I am not distracted by anything. 
In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

Maybe its laziness. The only concrete hobby i have is the internet.   Soon winter break will be over and I'm going to half to pretend like i am super energetic, cause i lied about it in the first place. People often complain about my unresponsiveness to stuff, they ask if i need help. But it's not a cut and dry (that the saying?) answer. Do i need help? Am i being overdramatic?

I’ve always been what you would call an overachiever, you know, that person who seems to have figured out everything in her life. Not being able to find a job and adjusting to my old (but new) life again, have taken a toll on my mental health. I spend most of my days crying, barely eat, always feel tired, force myself to be social, and pretend I’m doing great on social media. I am not ok. The bag of expectations feels so heavy, I’m questioning myself most of the time, and feel so anxious. It’s hard to talk about this to others since I feel embarrassed about myself. My mom knows I’m struggling with my emotions but her only advice is “pray”. I applied for grad school and still feel I’m not good enough. I know I sound like a spoiled brat and people out there have it way worse than I do. I know this isn’t the end of the world, but it sometimes feel like it is.

Shout out to the lady with a stroller I let go ahead of me (of course)  on the bus who asked if I'm OK because I look so sad. Sorry for lying and sorry that you had to see it.

I am hurting and it sucks to be alone. I hope 2020 and the future 10 years will be kind to me. Even with those comments from people I still felt invisible on the way home.

I was so afraid they would “find me” and I didn’t want them left with life long issues stemming from that. 
They all already know mommy cries a lot in her room. My oldest doesn’t ask me to cook for him anymore and says it’s because he knows I’m always tired and need rest. 
I have suffered from depression for a few years, and more recently severe anxiety following a sexual assault from my stbx. A few days ago I found out stbx would not face any consequences for the assault, and I’m still processing that. But this morning, following a panic attack, it occurred to me that my kids are better off where they are. It hit me that I am not what is best for them. I’m nowhere near being that. No matter how much it pains me to be apart from them. No matter how badly I want them back. No matter how heartbreaking it is hearing them say “I want to go back with you mommy, I want to live with you”... I am not their best option.

20M, mandatory community service. I'm doing it at a library, I believe it was the only place left in my hometown right now to do it. So in a lot of ways I could say I'm lucky. Didn't have to move anywhere, didn't have to even change my gym membership or anything.
But the library is destroying my fucking head. It's me either doing overly easy tasks that have gotten pretty goddamn boring after 2 months of being there, or it's me having nothing to do because it often feels like they don't really even need me. But I still can't fill this time with something else like being on my phone or reading books or whatever because the staff still wants me to do something... even if there's nothing to do. You know the kind of people that just make no goddamn sense. Like how dare you just wait for more work!!! Do that thing again then even if there's no need to!!
I tried talking about this immediately with family etc, but they're just ignoring it. First they gave a pretty good point saying that it takes a couple weeks to a month for something to become a routine so just keep going. But now it's been 2 months of just endless slow, boring, mind-numbingly fucking frustrating days and I'm so tired of it. And of course now when I try talking about it, it's just ignored. It's that instant ""stop complaining"" thing. I read how it's about attitude often, and doing it just to be able to enjoy other things. But this library is in my FUCKING WAY constantly. Can't relax and enjoy movies, music, shows or games because the library's in my head constantly. If the two months had gone fast, 9 more wouldn't sound so bad. But they've been SO SLOW. Sooooooo slow. 9 more sounds awful.
Hitting a wall or screaming doesn't help. The only thing so far relieving some of the anger is hitting myself in the head and slapping myself hard. That's the only thing that lets some pressure and frustration out. Hitting objects doesn't help because it's me trying to find an alternative to real pain and violence, and those things are in my mind A LOT at the moment.
Over a year ago a childhood friend of mine killed himself because of bad depression and ignorant people around him just ignoring his dreams and not being supportive in any way or helping with his mental health. He was always a super ambitious and smart person. I'm not suicidal at the moment, but the more people just fucking ignore my terrible feelings and the more I'm forced to go to this place every day, the more I'm starting to like the idea of doing something bad. I don't know what's gonna happen if I hear ""you just gotta do it"" one more time.

train_pid_8226,"What is there? 2020 is just a number I have to endure until I give up : It’s not new, it’s just a day, I can’t feel awake or connected to the world 80% of the time.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me.",2

train_pid_8489,"Any advice? : So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.  
Your thoughts will be appreciated.",2

train_pid_5914,"Why does the concept of a ""normal life"" seem so unnatural, unattainable to me, as if I were a different species, I feel like I never belonged here like I missed out? : Hello r/depression.
I am 27 years of age and I live in Europe. I am a mess.
Throughout my life I had no concept about my purpose, my role here. It is as if everybody else has some impulse, some force driving them and they have it all figured out, but that force never reached me. Since I was little I always felt like I am missing something, a cause, a reason, a blueprint to whatever life is supposed to be. I don't particularly believe in destiny, but it scares me sometimes. My mother barely survived while being pregnant with me, she was extremely close to being killed, for several months, it is a story that is book worthy. I was also an accident, an unplanned child. What if my life is a mistake, a divine clerical error? It would perfectly explain my feelings of being lost, of no purpose. It is a weird thought, not something I'd honestly believe, but I have no better explanation. 
Why have I always felt this way? NOTHING makes sense to me. When I find some sense and I start to think I am recovering, in some time I come down crashing hard again. My depression and anxiety are a definite constant in my life.
I can't imagine myself waking up each day, getting ready, drinking coffee, working some job that is likely unfulfilling because I messed up my education, going home tired, thinking about what food to buy so I don't always eat the same boring things, waiting to get old... And just doing these same things every day, forever until I die. 
I haven't even started living properly yet and I am already tired. I see no sun on the horizon, I doubt I will find somebody who I will love and who will love me back, it seems like such a lottery, unattainable, because I could never just settle for some random person with whom I have anything less than a good emotional connection and understanding. I don't think I will ever find it, it feels like my depression, anxiety, and my lack of knowing how to deal with those in my formative years made me miss that particular train. 
I feel like I will simply die at some point, no sadness, no ceremony, just poof. 
I will never reach any peak I imagined for myself, because judging by my current trajectory, it is just a continuing trend of self disappointment. 
I am sad because I (like to think that I) have so much more to offer to this world than what I delivered, that opportunity and luck will all avoid me, that I will never reach my potentials in nearly anything.  Have I messed up my own chances of being happy just by being born with my ""stats""? It deeply scares me that I missed out on some key event, that it is all gone now, that I made some mistake, that there is nothing good in the future for me.
And what happens when I give up? That life I described earlier? I can't do it, I just can't, that is not me. But what then?
What do I want to do? I don't know, I never did. Never. 
What am I, who is this person supposed to be? I don't know. 
How do I escape this? I don't know.
I am lost. I always was, lately I have been trying to lie to myself that I am not, but I am. And with every second, my destiny of sorrow is more and more concrete.
I'm a mess.
I don't even know what the purpose of this post is, maybe I just needed to put this out. I am so lost. I don't understand anything.",1

We were born in different families but fated to meet.
I was so shy back then, so afraid of the world and how everyone thought of me. I was bullied for my differences from the crowd. I hated life back then, between the bullying and the abuse back home.
And then like an angel, you appeared. You spoke to me as if I was human and showed me empathy. And although I never asked, you stood up for me and wiped away my tears.
You were so beautiful to me, like a goddess and like the best friend I could ever wish for. Of course you had your flaws, don't we all, but i adored you despite them.
You were always so intelligent and bright but stubborn and short tempered. 
I know at times you do not feel loved but do you really need a lover to realize just how loved you are? Just how special you are? You are incredible in so many ways.
What makes you special? Your big and loving heart. Its not easy to see past the cover of a book to see its real beauty..but you..you do that better than anyone I know.
I know life is hard and you're fighting a hidden war but you always were a fighter- a warrior.  Look at the battles you've faced and how much stronger you are because you never gave up. I've always been proud of you for that.
I know it is not much to offer but because i love you whole heartedly, you will always find a friend in me",0

He comes back with these two paragraphs of how depressed he is and I instantly felt horrible. He's separated from his wife and the peak of the divorce is coming up. The house they lived in together is going up on the market soon finally (she still lives in it with their two kids), he's living in his parents basement, lost his job but started his own company which has got him extremely busy and exhausted lately, and he is just experiencing the holidays in this situation for the first time. He told me he's feeling a lot of guilt and self hatred. He's hurting for his kids going through all this. Told me he dreads waking up, he sits and stares at the wall a lot and cries every day. He's not eating and hides in his room when he's home. He just completely spilled his guts. I was there for him and have been since. But one thing started bothering me throughout this. He has never once said he loves me since this all started. I tell him all the time, I text him ""goodnight I love you"", ill randomly text him that I love him throughout the days.

I’m in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it’s nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It’s so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends. 
   Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they’re divorced). I’ve been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don’t know how to explain it, like I’m definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more ‘off’ days than I’d like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn’t help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society. 
    I have 2 sisters (I’m the middle), and we’re all super close. I’m very close with my mom as well, and I’ve told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can’t self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can’t fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I’ve tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We’ve seen symptoms when she was younger but it’s gotten worse. She’s attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she’s home alone, I can only imagine what she’s going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m always ‘overthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitive’. Usually one of her 3 responses to my ‘episodes’.

I have been discussing antidepressants with my GP, and I am considering asking for agomelatine/valdoxan. My main concerns with medication are: no sexual side effects, and no extensive tapering needed when stopping the medication. I have tried mirtazapine but found the zombie like foggy feelings too much to tolerate, and I am in the UK so Wellbutrin is not an option.  
Agomelatine seems to fit my criteria, but I have come across a couple of anecdotes about sexual side effects developing after a longer period of time on this medication, and I wanted to ask if anyone could give me more information/any more anecdotes regarding sexual side effects of this drug. I know it is generally considered to have very few sexual side effects, especially compared to other antidepressants, but I want to understand if this means essentially no potential for such side effects, or just a very low incidence.
Furthermore, I am aware that sexual dysfunction can persist after stopping medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. Does anyone know if there is a similar risk with agomelatine? Sexual dysfunction is something I have struggled with in the past, and I am absolutely unwilling to risk potentially permanent side effects, so I want to be aware before discussing with my doctor since he is not overly informed about the exact side effects of particular psychiatric medications. 
Thanks in advance :)",2

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

train_pid_2139,"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn’t, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn’t push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that’s fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I’m cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there’s something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It’s easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don’t get me wrong It’s hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don’t fight what’s the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it’s also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I’ve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what’s stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I’m not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don’t use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I’m tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can’t outthink feelings. it’s time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. 

If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I’m tired of feeling and living this way and I’m sure I’m not the only one.",1

train_pid_5812,"I hate my life, myself, so much so that it is becoming unbearable now. : I have a happy family, good friends, and had a good opportunity to make it big in life but ever since my 16th birthday, everything has been different and difficult. Ever since I joined hostel my life went upside down. I started alcohol, cigarettes and heck even drugs at times. But the pain and the thought of ""you're useless, a burden, a nobody"" just won't go away. There are voices in my head which tells me that I'm wrong. I'm bad. I'm meant to be sad and feel shit all my life.
Since last year, I've been suicidal and you know the worst thing? I can't even talk about it. Mental health is taboo in my country. If you speak about it, people take you up for being retarded or just an imbecile. I prefer not to speak about it for that reason. Not family nor friends. I dunno what to do too. I'm no more happy. I have HS finals in April but I still don't have the ability to get out of the bed and open my god damn books. It's like I'm stuck. I watch movies, everyday and watch cartoons of Batman or Superman to keep myself up. And honestly, even if this sounds weird or obnoxious to some extent, the only reason why I haven't roped it in is because I think Batman wouldn't have liked it. 
The problem is that I don't blame my parents for having sex one freaking night and reproducing me, I don't blame society to put me up with this shit. I don't blame anyone. I blame myself. I hate myself. I hate myself so fuckin much that it's to the point I can't, I just can't handle it anymore. Since last year I've been planning to do it. Rope it in. I don't wanna live anymore. It's just too much for me. I'm so bummed out by this disease that I've even managed to push away few good friends who were genuine to me. I feel like an asshole but you know, I think it's for the betterment of them not to be with me. I have had crushes on soo many girls but let's face it, it's futile. Even if I managed to befriend one of them, I would just end up scaring them away with my depression.
P.S : I just wanted to open up about this. I've been into this sub for a few days now and there are many posts/people who go through the same as me. I feel sad and sadder reading them. I want these voices to go away but I don't think it'll, will it?",1

Guess my birth parents wanted me about as much as everyone else in my life has so far. Either way, my adopted mom bought me a few books in relation to adoption to read when I was young. Where is said adopted mom now you ask? In another state, with her new husband, my older brother whom she manipulated into moving in with her, spending her days lying to all her friends about what a horrible daughter I am for abandoning her, about how her ex husband divorced her when it was the other way around, conveniently never discusses the money she steals from my dad every month,  believing she’s “worthy of it because of the kids I raised”, and hasn’t spoken to me in over a year because I blocked her after she straight up “forgot” to answer a phone call we scheduled to have! 

So yeah. Why should I look at a bunch of books all dedicated to to reminding me how much an adoptive family should love their child just as much as a birth child, when that was never the case for me? And when my adoptive father also has mental problems and a drinking problem but refuses to get help, and complains about how in debt he is and how bad his physical health is when he won’t get any help for that either? Yeah he has to pay my mom a scathing amount every month, but still. He’s admitted he doesn’t wanna work because he’s depressed but he won’t get help for his depression. But still feels the need to say things like, “I don’t know how much longer I can do any of this.” And talk about losing is job and if he does will definitely lose our house. See, I don’t get to talk about my problems. Cause I clearly don’t have any. But everyone else sure as hell does! 

And as stated before my one older brother lives with my mom and being the lying, manipulative, gas lighting, snake she is she convinced him not to have anything to do with the rest of the “family.” 

And my oldest brother is too busy with his beloved wife and life of his own to really understand the problems the rest of us face.

Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother?

And I was after losing my last place at the Uni did I really evaluate my life, so I ditched that horrible toxic group in a real world that was making me feel absolutely shitty, the superficial conversations and completely bunked turning up to Jim’s Cafe. I didn’t feel like a huge loss at hurt me it felt like a relief and one less problem to deal with. I had a lovely couple of months being indoors which suited my own personality and what I wanted in life, got back into music, writing and soon began see a positives.

I then started making goals for myself, my first goals were to get up every morning so I did, I then I quit sugar and that made things easier and began exercising.  Then I started thinking what I wanted to do so, so I applied for my degree in social work and within weeks in, I was actually a student and doing something meaningful and productive again.

My ups didn’t last long as student fiancé had messed up my passport and literally a few days before the end of the term gather a years a terms, and this time I wasn’t that backing down leave part way through the year, self resilience and determination got me through that bump and thankfully the fees were sorted student finance admitted their mistakes I can finally see things getting slightly better

Then on the 16th December I got the call that my uncle lost his short battle with cancer and ended up having a very scaled down Christmas, didn’t feel like putting on Xmas films as I was upset and in shock, to this I’m still in this numb place and then add extra pressure I didn’t pass my first exam and that really pushed things right into the dark place. I was already upset that my uncle had passed away at 65 and this really pushed my back into self destructive ways . 

New Years Eve came and i has lovely night with family and my journey continues

But onwards and upwards. 

Things I am glad about: 
No more meaningless groups ruining my mh 
Starting my degree in Social Work, my ten year battle of getting in professional course was over, no more messing around saying ” I don't have GCSE’s”,  the wouldn't take me seriously, why can't I just sign jobseekers? I have put myself through a lot and my parents.

train_pid_5649,"I feel stuck in my own self. : Hey all, first off I want to thank anyone spends their time reading this, theres so many things anyone can be doing and you choose to accompany people online who need it. Thank you, I appreciate all of you to no end for that. Im posting this because I don't feel like anyone I know would want to hear this.
I just plain hate myself, and I feel stuck with being myself. I feel like others look down on me as a lesser person, like a guy you just wouldn't want to spend time with. By expressing these feelings, I get the thought that it only predisposes people to think I really AM a lesser person. Of course I mostly keep these feelings to myself, both because of that and knowing that most people dont want to be brought down by others weight, I understand that. So I keep these feeling to myself and try to be the best person I can everyday, and focus on self improvement and social skills. But despite this I have trouble making new friends, while my existing friends seem to always slowlydrift away from me. I cannot tell what is my own confirmation bias about what people dont like about me and what they actually dont like about me.
My last group of friends I had I had to cut off, after realizing they  were not the best group for me. What made me realize this is when we all planned a road trip. I had told them day 1 when we made the plan that I would not be able to drive because my parents didnt want me driving on a trip as far as we were going. 2 Days before we planned to leave. The friend that was driving me couldn't go anymore, so I was without a ride. The 2 others driving both had 2 seats open each. But said I couldn't come along because ""They just dont want me in their car"". It made me feel super left out and crushed, because the others in private would say it was all childish, but none would actually speak up for me. The 2 driving would say ""Just drive anyway who cares what your parents say"" as if I could just disobey my parents like that. What happens when I come back if I did drive, you know? I can't just disrespect the rules of the house I live in, besides they had a total of 4 open seats. Much more than enough room. They then proceeded to try and make me pay for my room for them still. If anyone reading knows anything about hotels, you are more than able to call and change your plan to stay there such as one less room etc. The friend who booked the hotel had confirmed this and gave me my money back(in private), while the rest of the group thought that I was an asshole for taking the money from my room back (even though they canceled the room).
So since then I havent spent time with them becuase they all clearly didn't want me around. And few that felt it was wrong didn't care enough say a word in my defense, despite the open seats and trying to extort my money for my room that they could refund.
I have since felt very depressed, instead of having a group to hangout with every weekend I now spend 9/10 days alone in my room thinking about the friends I once had, convinced Im just some asshole whos incapable of knowing right from wrong. Too introverted to put myself out there and make new friends. I've never felt so alone in my life. My very loving family that I'm thankful for, is really all that keeps me going these days.",1

Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother?

Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state.

Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us.

Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that.

I start to think that there must be something wrong with them or they’re trying to use me in some way because how could someone with a sensible mind ever truly like me.

I told him how I never organise anything for my birthday because my friends all let me down, and that it is actually a really depressing time for me. I have gained such a complex over the years with my birthday. My friends and family very rarely celebrate it with me, and when they do, its over during NYE celebrations, or ends up being an extremely mild affair. I see so many people throughout the year get completely spoiled on their birthdays. While I have got used to this disappointment, I was looking forward to this year, as my Boyfriend is a very thoughtful person, so I thought he would pull out all the stops. Turns out he didnt. His birthday was in November, and I took us on holiday for it. However, when I asked him yesterday if he planned anything, he hadn't. So I booked the restaurant. He has kids from a previous marriage, and I then realised that he has the kids that weekend. He said he would rearrange it, which he did, but I'm gutted, and heart broken tbh. I put so much thought into his birthday, yet he couldnt be bothered to organise anything for mine, or even confirming whether he had his kids that weekend or not. Its sorted, we're going to a nice restaurant sat night for my birthday, but I feel so let down that he was so thoughtless. Any suggestions on how I should move forward, in terms of how I should deal with this with my BF (btw, we have already had a huge argument about it, where he claimed i said i didnt want to do anything, which was not the case, but I'm struggling to move on). But more importantly, in terms of what I should do about taking ownership of this. I am so sick of feeling let down and unworthy every time I have a birthday, anyone have any tips on things I should do for myself for my birthday, to ensure I get to feel that love and sense of being valued that I enviously witness other people experience throguhout the year?",1

I'm currently exiting a 4 and a half year relationship wherein I was mentally and physically abused. I abuse drugs sometimes to escape, pills and alcohol. I have no job, I quit my last one due to anxiety attacks. I just got academically dismissed from university because I dipped below a 2.0.

I have PTSD from my brother and my dad physically and mentally abusing me as well as serious bullying in middle school, I still live with them and they stopped but still treat me like shit. My mom was addicted to drugs for the last few years of her life and died of an overdose in front of me when I was 16, both grandfathers passed around then as well. My sister died in August.

I can't function. Therapy doesn't help, anti-depressants don't help, the only thing that helps is sleep, and I want to do that forever. I don't feel anything from music or video games or movies. I got kicked out of choir because I was ""there, but wasn't present"" (I was just going through the motions). Every important relationship in my life has been abusive. I have no friends. Every day I think about committing suicide, and I've been admitted twice and have called the suicide hotline multiple times. All I have are negative thoughts, the only thing I feel physically is a dry mouth, sweat palms and a pounding heart.

train_pid_7730,"I don't know what to do : So first of all English isn't my first language . But nontheless i'll try my best.  
I have been finding myself in a situation for the last 3 years . And I am not able to get myself out of it.   
I have a severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I already made clear with myself that i won't commit suicide. I've always been very curious and inquisitive and i don't what to miss anything in the future. That's why I could never do it. BUT that doesn't stops me from thinking about it. I think I know the 2 main reasons for my depression. My family and my social life better to say lack there of. My family actually seems like the nice family from next door. We never had any money problems or anything like that. But on the inside my family is falling apart. My biggest brother confessed last year to my mother that he is depressed and he couldn't go to work that day because he couldn't be sure he wouldn't drive his car in a wall. He went to a op psychiatric clinic. At first it seemed like my mother and him would start to get back together and were starting to build up a strong bond between them. But then it all went south. They only were fighting when she would visit him. It got to that point that my brother broke with my family and as he got out of the clinic he moved out. My mother is a mess since she knew about his depression. I think it's because that she thinks she messed up as a mother. But she doesn't only think that because of my biggest brother my second brother. Is also drifting away from us. He gets aggressiv real fast and is almost never at home. Only to sleep.. Sometimes not even that. My little sister shows signs of a depression too for a while now. She doesn't have any good friends in school and the story of my brother seems to do also a great part on her. No we finally get to me. I also don't have any good friends. There is nobody I could talk to. But first I want to finish the part about my family. I am kind of a geek. So as soon I noticed some weird behavior of my dad. I installed a software on his laptop. 2 Days later I got the result I was waiting for. He used multiple dating sites to flirt with other women I couldn't find out if he already met with someone but I believe that he did. Anyway I got him to stop it. At least he doesn't use sites like these on his laptop anymore. I didn't talk to him. I don't want to say how I did it but I believe it worked. He doesn't know that I know about his secret. But I am still in a dilemma. Do I tell my mom about it and definitely destroy our family and let my sister grow up with divorced parents or do I keep it for myself and I can't look my father in the eyes. I have kept everything secret for 2 years now. But still haven't decided what to do. My current plan is to break with my family in few years. As soon as I am financially stable enough to life on my own. I don't want to risk needing to come back to my family because of financial problems or anything like that. My second problem is my social life. As I already said i have no real friends. That is not really true I do have a friend. My best friend. But we after school he moved to another city. We rarely see each other. And each year it gets less. I can't talk to him about my problems because he got some weight to carry aswell and I don't want him to be concerned about me. I am singel for 3 years now. I only had one girlfriend. And she was abusive towards me. Since that I almost never talked to a girl of my age group outside of work. And I feel that I am drifting closer towards the abyss each day. I wake up go to work get home go into my room and go to sleep. There is rarely something that disturbs that circle. My biggest fear is if I break with my family and move to another city that I won't meet new friends. And in the end I die alone. With no fun in life. I don't know what to do and how to get out of this situation.

Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",1

I've been dealing with my mental health for about four years, but have only been diagnosed for the past two. I don't want to overshare or make them feel like they have to fix anything - I basically just summarized what’s going on.
They took it surprisingly well, saying things along the lines of  *""I'm glad you told me""* and *""Let me know if you need anything"".*
I don't know if I'll ever be able to fully open up (or if i even should) because I feel like the more I say, the more they'll push me away, and I don't want that to happen. 
I have been hurt by so many people, parents included, that I don't even know if I can trust that they mean it. I put so much value into my friends because my relationship with my parents hasn't always been the best. I love them to death and I would do anything for them. The fact that I am afraid to trust them completely is not because of anything they have done. It's just me, remembering how people have lied to me before. I just don't want that to happen again.
My depression has been getting worse lately, which is the only reason I told anyone in the first place. I feel like I can't get through this by myself, but I also feel completely unlovable and like a burden on anyone that I tell. I don't even know if people would still be friends with me if I completely opened up and told them what I'm dealing with. I am trying to get therapy at my college's health center (they’re booked up) but I still feel completely alone.

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

train_pid_6295,Happy New Year : [removed],0
train_pid_3318,"I hate myself so much that it spreads around me at times : Hi,

Before I begin, I am sorry for my language skills, it isn't my native tongue and I am not the best writer. This is the first time I express myself. I have nobody else but here.

  
In my country at schools retakes are once a year at the end of academic semesters where one retake can make you pass or fail the whole year. Until university I always slacked around and was practicing programming. At the end of each academic year I would attend all retakes and pass with C or above. However, we had those meetings where teachers would give feedback about us to our parents. And teachers always said ""Kuzenet is very kind and quiet. He is a nice boy, maybe the nicest in the class but he doesn't study at all."" These words would render my mother super angry. Every time she is back from those meetings I would get yelled at and my mother would cry every time. I am very sensitive and it was very damaging for me. Not to mention i did get beaten up a couple of times due to my mother's anger. My father would make his grumpy face - i would rather prefer someone torturing me instead of seeing him like that for months. He would never talk to me with a happy and welcoming tone. I could tell he wants me to go away as soon as possible his sentence is over from his tone. By the time my parents get better, another meeting would happen and all would reset. This loop begun in primary school until the end of high school.  


The reason why I mention this is because, now I feel incredibly inferior although I got scholarship and a part time engineering job. I feel very stupid at work and at university as well. Especially because the fact that I started university a lot later than my peers. I have no friends, literally zero. People only text me when they need help with assignments or when they study for exams. People I helped gave me nice feedback all the time about how their grades improved thanks to my assistance and all. No friends from that either. I pick foods that don't damage your brain but I love chocolate and every time I eat chocolate I feel very guilty thinking the sugar will dampen my cognitive abilities once sugar levels go down. All I wanted was friends that I can listen to, text with, read their messages. My phone doesn't function well for the past year and I didn't get a new one because there is no use for it in my life.  


I read a lot of suggestions online about going to rock climbing or something like that, but I am not into that and besides, I am living abroad. It is really hard to make any friends when you are a foreigner even if you are a fit in their culture just because you don't know the language that well. There is also the fact that some people don't like the country I came there from. They have assumptions about people from there and they avoid me at first. I do not put in the effort of proving them I am worth their time because I also don't think I am a great person either. I am only good at solving problems when people have one. Other than that, I don't know what to do.  


This consistent anger at myself being stupid and incompetent makes me short tempered at my parents. When I visit them I get easily annoyed. Today I made my father upset, I am very afraid of losing my parents as I think as people age they can't endure sadness or stress well and each time they are upset, I get 10x more depressed at least. My hatred towards myself is just adding up. This ends up being a infinite loop.  


I remember I was a very happy kid but nowadays nothing makes me happy. This has been going on for about 8 years. Everything is black and white. I attract no-one, I don't look into mirror for the past 8 years and I overthink everything.  


I hate myself to the fullest and I can't forgive how many times I made my parents upset. I failed a business before starting university due to third-party conditions. It wasn't my fault but still, I am the one who caused a loss. While I am not considering suicide because I can't do that to my parents, I don't feel alive at all. I live to work, yet I fail at being successful.",1

I am usually a timid person but I have destroyed the room, cut my legs and wrists up to hell and back (self harm) and cried for probably 3 days. My heart rate is so fast that I’ve just begun to ignore it, it feels like a 3 day long anxiety attack, I’ve almost hung myself and I cussed out my mother in law (I’ve never cussed at anyone over 25) and I am having unending suicidal thoughts like they’re just background noise now.
The scariest part is I’ve been hearing voices, yes voices, not thoughts. Once telling me to die and when I think the voices won’t let me finish my sentences without fucking up the sentence. Like I want to go to the (store) but instead I’ll hear barn or something like that. Also, the room was spinning a lot but since has stopped. 
I was already severely suicidal and depressed but this rage is unmanageable, I have a bad temper but never am so upfront with it. I fear I’m having a schizophrenic break, my abusive dad before we got away from him was a paranoid of some kind. Not sure what kind.

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",2

train_pid_3305,"Cringing over my own socializing attempts : A few weeks ago a friend invited me to her party. I was struggling to motivate myself and get out of bed but I had promised her I would come and eventually I got dressed.

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems. In those moments I really had the feeling that I am making progress and this will help me. And even though they listened to me now it just feels like being a burden and a cry-baby.

I really feel uncomfortable caging while presenting my character as a self-victimising OP.. maybe that current thinking is just fueling that behaviour.. so whatever I just skip the typical overthinking we all know, as I'm not here to seek for affirmation. I'm a stoic buddhist and I'm well aware of the natural contrast life gifts me to accept and grow out of; Darkness is, with a sparkling accentuation,  just as beautiful as light with some dark emphasising spots, as long as the intensities swap!
 I'm no fan of overly optimising myself and certainly not others, I just live by what my spirituality opens up and what I learned from 7 years of psychotherapy wich helped me to work on compulsions and past-depression. But here we are. 
As I constantly got more confident with myself, let go from my manifested illusions about social media, never drank alcohol again and being generally more physically and artistically active in the past few months, I lost a lot of friends, but as I am positively aware of changement and as I don't want to cage them as thoughts in my head and give them the space also in real life, I went on and thought ""This is absolutely okay, it might be interesting when you some day meet them as they are a totally different person or you see them with different eyes by then!"" 
I stopped smoking and then a big part of my clique broke away, same thoughts but they were a bit questioning this time... 
I tried to motivate my friends to go outside as almost everyone just smoked pot indoors and I felt really tired (not by the smoke, I always left when the room got too cloudy) when hanging around and just watch some movies. I decided to search for cool places in the woods where they could hang while being able to smoke and maybe experience some kind of ""wildlife"" adventure. They really liked it! But it got boring soon I guess so we ended up again indoors. I decided to look for new people, maybe a whole new constellation could bring some dynamic into my life and motivates the core part :)
But then my best and last friends felt betrayed and I got no luck meeting new people in my region as they all think I'm too weird. Also I don't like going into clubs where there is loud and disturbing electronical music ... I'm deeply alone now, also my parents and siblings don't want to talk to me as they can't understand why I converted to buddhism. I simply can't constantly meditate to achieve wisdom on how to feel social fulfillment without ever talking to anyone. I am convinced about the flame of life that resides with all of us, that we are all part of a big entity so I don't care if people like me or not, but being absolutely alone now is very depressing and seeds great doubts.

train_pid_8274,"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting.

I was (and still am) extremely depressed, but it came in waves. I am 17 now and have tried to kill myself 6 times and ended up in the hospital 4 times. My family has in no way supported me and constantly  tries to put me down. Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.

They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

It doesn't happen and I can't get it to. I feel like there's something wrong that this ability or natural reaction is gone for me. Maybe it would be helpful or cathartic to let things out, but I'm unable to get myself to cry. 

My depression mostly feels like nothingness instead of sadness, but there's a lot of sadness I think I need to feel to get over things, but it's like I can't make myself experience these emotions.

train_pid_8739,"I am jealous of people who can get drugs that can numb the pain : I just had a revelation and I need to tell someone. 
I have had depression since I was 10. My narcissistic dad has been emotionally and physically abusive a long before that. My mom cheating triggered his behaviour. I'm close to 30 now and they are still together. This has made my teenage years hard and naturally due to shitty homelife as a person I was a wreck, which led to me being bullied in school for 10 years. I hated life in school and at home. I almost killed myself when I was 12 but did't because I wanted my little brother to have one person in their life that did't cause him pain. It has been a close call multiple times since that. 
Currently I live with my boyfriend of 8 years in our own home a happy life. I have been in therapy for 4 years and am currently unempoyed to focus on therapy to get better and he supports it 100%. Seems nice right? I am low contact with my parents but have thought going no contact many times. I do not sleep. I don't think I have ever had a proper good night sleep. I have nightmare seasons (that's what I call them..) and have nightmare every night for weeks. I'm going on 3weeks and 4 nights at the moment, so I have not rested properly during this time. I seek comfort in food and occasionally in alcohol. I have never drank alcohol to party, I drink because I neeeeed a break from my head that keeps telling me to kill myself. I really want to die. I think of it as a dream that I want to achieve. I would love to be freed from this pain that I feel everyday. I have depression, anxiety and PTSD. I am tired. 
I am writing this because I was watching a documentary about teenagers with drug problems. I related to them so much, their pain is what I feel. The thing that scared me was that I found myself being jealous. I wanted the drugs that would make me numb for a while. I have never tried anything other than alcohol, but I think that if I had had the chance I would have gone that road and I would have killed myself. I would have peace and would be in eternal dream or nightmare, with my luck it would be a nightmare. Luckily I have no way to obtain any sort of drugs, just more therapy. I have so many mixed feelings about life at the moment, the pain seems just too big. 
On one hand I have an amazing life that could be even better once I get better. On the other hand it seems that I have no power and no strenght in me to be any better. I just would like a few days without the pain, just a little break so I can sleep and gather energy. I feel like this whole text is a mess, I'm sorry.",2

hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager I loved creative writing but now when I do it it's more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment.

I don't really understand people who look forward to things - I used to! but, well...

I genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die.

I do laugh and have love a lot. I genuinely don't believe I'm depressed. I function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but I know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything?

I consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though I'm regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken.

even the shows and books and stuff that I think I love don't really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. I feel like any reaction I have to my friends (like: ""GOD IM SO SAD ABOUT [chapter]"") is 100% habit.


TLDR: i dont really feel much enjoyment, purpose,  or strong emotions at all, but i function well and am a goofy person. is there a chance i could get medical help for this despite not being depressed?",0

I saw a psychotherapist (£70 a week!) for a couple of months. He said I didn't realise it, but just by being me I make a lot of people feel insecure. That always sounded like BS to me but it stuck with me anyway.

train_pid_39,"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",1

train_pid_5820,"Failing grades : Hello everyone, I’m new to Reddit (in an attempt to seek help and advice) 
I (18F) have struggled with the feeling of underwhelming sadness for about 3 years. The reason I don’t give this a title, such as depression, is because I haven’t seeked medical advice or been diagnosed - so I don’t feel it’s appropriate to diagnose myself. But I do believe it may be a case of depression. 
I didn’t enjoy school due to lack of understanding particular subjects and feeling I was more behind than my peers. The only subjects I excelled in was Art &amp; Design and English. But despite even that, I was so unmotivated to do it and I could’ve really hit the high grades if I had tried harder and studied before exams, something I didn’t do. 
From a young age I took to a passion for Aviation. I remember flying for the first time and being absolutely drawn in to the industry. I remember my flight being delayed for 2 hours and the entire time I had my little face pressed up against the glass over looking the Airside area, fixed to the activity going on below and taking it all in. My ambition was to be a flight attendant. After finishing school at 16, I got a place in my dream college. A college specific for Aviation. It was a long way from home but I managed to make it work. I’m still attending now, this is my second year. 
And this second year is what I would like to address in this passage. The issue is that I am behind in my work... extremely behind. I have no other excuse than myself for this. I’m going to try and explain this the best way I can in the hopes some of you guys may have been through similar, if not the same thing. 
I absolutely love the subject I am studying and I’m very blessed to be attending and have a seat in the class. I still very much wish to be a flight attendant, so it’s not a case of not having a passion for learning. I want to learn. I haven’t lacked motivation in that area, but where my work is concerned I just cannot do it. It’s not a case of not understanding, because when I do eventually get around to my work, I believe I can do it well. I just cannot bring myself to be organised, motivated and work before the deadline. Even after my work is late, I simply cannot force myself to address it. It’s like a weight that holds me down in my bed and convinces me the work can be left. 
I don’t know how to describe it. 
I can’t be organised and do my work in regular intervals to ensure my work meets the deadline. It’s like a constant fight between my heart and my head. 
I hate disappointing my tutors, which have been so lovely to me, however I have not spoken to them about how I feel. I feel guilty and ashamed when I walk into college without the work they have been expecting or expected. 
I want to be successful in my course but I’m proving not to be, and if I’m unlucky, I worry for my place on the course. 
Sometimes the paperwork doesn’t make sense to me and I cannot understand what is being asked of me. 
I am extremely sad about this because I work outside of college and I am a good, understanding and hard worker. I’m better at practical work than class-based. I believe I could be a successful flight attendant, given the opportunity... but I’m worried I will not achieve the grades to get there due to these issues.

train_pid_5377,"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life?

I think a life like this isn’t worth living, and I’ve considered taking my life( but I wouldn’t because it would devastate my parents). I’ve always been a introvert, but I’ve really started pulling away from society. I find myself becoming more sympathetic to incel ideology, and I’m scared.

Me too"" . . .  And your left there like ""ok sure let's talk about you"" and suddenly your turning into your friends therapist. You find yourself telling your friend that you cant their significant other did that while Internally your dying but in a weird way it is a relief b.c you were distracted from the legit nothingness you feel inside. 
I hate when you even tell people you have depression and you suddenly get ""omg same me too"" and once again your hearing about their problems. Then you have nothing to respond with because in reality you have no problems and no reason to be depressed.  You just are. 
How do you try to explain to someone that you cant handle the tight feeling in your chest, the loneliness, the desire to break down, freak out and end it all when you have no reason to feel that way. My life is great looking in. I have a great job, I make good money, have an amazing boyfriend.  I could use some more friends but that stems from my lack of getting out of the house. So what the fuck! Do I feel so fucking aweful.  I spend my time in the shower crying so my boyfriend doesn't know. I love to cook and am all about taking care of the man who takes care of me all the time but when I feel like shit and cant think straight I make terrible food and bless his heart he eats it. I burn everything because I cant focus. I just space out b.c when I'm zoned out I get a moment to feel nothing at all. I love that moment.  
I just feel so bad when I try to talk to someone cuz yeah anyone else I'm talking to does have it worse than me. I'm like yup your life sucks. You win.  While I'm just miserable and for no reason.  How do you talk to someone in a generation of who's life is worse. I just want to die. I'm so alone u work hard and for what? Theres 100% no point.  I could do less work and just make enough money to get by but my work is my escape. It's the one thing that forces me to get up and excel at something.  Then it ends. I come home, walk my dogs(thank god for them, for being my reason to literally keep going when I come home from work) then I shower cook have about an hr to myself and i do again everyday is a distraction so why the fuck am I living ? 
If everyday is just another day successfully lived then why do it ?? It just doesnt make sence. As far as suicide... I'll be honest I have FOMO. What keeps me from ending it is the thought that one day I'll be ok. One day. I do well at work b.c. I push myself to distract myself and I'm good at it so why!!! Cant I push myself into something productive outside of work. I try to workout but I dont want to be without my dogs.

train_pid_8665,"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   
I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  
So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

TL;DR life’s been hard and I feel broken and hopeless. does anyone relate",1

There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.

train_pid_198,"Considering trying to get antidepressants. Scare to start and worried about weight gain. : I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression (moderately high functioning though) and anxiety but I didn’t have the right kind of insurance to do anything about it. I’ve got a primary doctor picked out (haven’t had one in like five years) and a therapist picked out. I just can’t work up the guts to make the appointments. I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll talk to the doctor about it and they’ll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won’t help. If I try and it fails then that’s the final nail in the coffin, there’s no hope because I tried so much already. 

And there’s the looming possible weight gain. I’m 5’3” female and 205lbs. I went from a very fit 142lbs (26% body fat) in 2015 to 205lbs (42% body fat) and out of shape now. I know how to eat well and I love exercising but I just can’t anymore. I despise how I look already so being super depressed sounds better than continuing to gain weight. 

How am I supposed to walk into a new doctor and be like “hey, doc. I’m super depressed and anxious as fuck. How about some antidepressants? Oh and none that’ll make me gain weight. K thanks.” (Obviously I would be more professional, I’m just making jokes as coping.)",1

train_pid_4667,"Anyone else overcome with numbness? : I’m (32F) medicated for long-standing depression and anxiety. The medication is working, and I’m not suicidal. 

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. 

My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don’t want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn’t functioning.

My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

In 2019 the company I work for has gone through a big transition from small company to bigger player in the field. A few of our senior workers didn’t like the change so I’ve stepped up (by my own choice, my bosses are actually fantastic and would never ask) and worked longer hours and weekends to keep everything going. I’m up for a huge promotion next year because of it.


Towards the end of the year I noticed I was getting more tired and snappy so I booked a long break over Christmas where we’d normally shut down, assuming it was exhaustion. Now I’m off I feel like it’s gotten worse. 


Spending time with people annoys me, I don’t find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven’t left the house or showered for a week because I haven’t needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.


I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn’t want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.


I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t talk to anyone about this and I have extremely bad experiences with doctors when I’ve tried to go to them about my anxiety. I just hope I’m not broken forever.",1

But you see, today's January 1st and I feel the need to say all of this, why?! Well because the last couple of years were so bad that they were the worst of my life, in 2017 I was diagnosed with anxiety and last year, 2019, I found out I had depression. I learned what was loosing someone I loved and cared, I thought I was going to die, but thankfully I was strong enough to ask for help and out an end to this bullshit. I was tired of being unhappy, I was tired of every single day thinking that I had a new kind of terminal desease, I was tired of being that version of me!! I had to do something about it...

And so I did, this is my last month of treatment, I'm nervous, but I'm happy. I felt like 2019 was a prison and a constantly reminder of the shit I had been through. Thank God, 2020 is finally here, and that means 2019 belongs in the past, in a chapter of my life that I left behind, and it's never ever coming back. 

I'll no longer be that girl, that tries to please others and forgets about her own happiness, that girl that thinks she doesn't deserve the good things in life, that girl who thinks she was dumb and an idiot, who thought she was too much fat, had too much boobs, eated too much, laughed too loud, socialized too less... but you know what?! She's a woman now, she's an adult and she has realized that she's beatiful, and smart, and fun, and caring, and loving and if she fights for what she wants she deserves everything good that comes into her life. Fuck what everyone thinks, fuck what the old her thought.

She found herself, her real self, and even though not every day is a good day, she knows that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or the next day, will be better!! She is loved and loves herself...

I hope everyone that suffers from depression can find the light in the end of the tunnel as I did. You're not alone, you're beautiful and you're loved...

Happy New Year and may this one bring the change that you all deserve, xoxo",1

I have thought of self harm but I can’t because I feel that I will do something that will harm my family more than me (I’ve read on this sub that parents that have to burry or see a child die is the worst possible feeling) I can’t bring myself to do it. But tonight (and also a few other times) I heard my mom talking about how I am a burden on her and how I’m stressing and how me and my problems are effecting her daily life and her mental health. Now I feel like absolute shit I have no idea what to do. Well thanks for trying to read my dumb story and happy new year to all (hope it starts off better than mine),1

train_pid_2670,"Can I take a moment just to rant? : So, my gf’s birthday is coming up. Unfortunately, she has extracurricular activities that will prevent her from having a party (she’s turning 16, so it’s kind of a big deal lol) her mom and I want her to have an absolutely amazing party. So, her mom scheduled the party to February 15th. That’s a few weeks away from her actual birthday. But get this, my birthday is on the 14th of February and she’ll be celebrating hers after mine. Kinda hurts, but I don’t care too much. What bothers me is that they all said that they were gonna do something special for me on my birthday, but it looks like that’s not gonna happen. Maybe I’m being a little bitch. Maybe I’m just being an ass, but I can’t help but feel a little upset that they decided to schedule her party the day after my “big day.”",1

train_pid_8643,i want to scream : i’m so angry all the time anymore. as long as i’ve had MDD (more than 8 years now) i’ve been so tired. that tired that sleep can’t fix. my job makes me miserable but it’s the only one in my area that pays well enough to give me an opportunity out. my situation makes me miserable. everything makes me tired. everything seems like an effort. i want to scream and break down almost every day and i just don’t have the energy or am at work and have to hold it all in for my 14 hour days. i’ve never been an addict but it’s still a struggle not to throw my life away to drugs in order to stop feeling this way. i know all my therapy in theory but nothing seems to work in practice. words can’t describe how much i hate this. the worst is mentally begging for help that isn’t there because in reality the only one who can fix me is me. i just want to lay down forever in my warm safe bed and fall asleep and never wake up,2

train_pid_2046,"i don’t know how to say this in any other way so- : me: *self-diagnosis: depression, anxiety, maybe bipolar disorder...*
also me: I don’t wanna self diagnose myself and no one can prove i have mental problems because i’ve never seen anyone. i can’t say i have depression because i don’t know and so i can’t tell anyone because i wasn’t professionally diagnosed 😎",1
train_pid_8578,"Venting a bit : I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. 
Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section.
Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” 
It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don’t know where I’d be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being. 
I don’t want to get too political on this sub but honestly fuck capitalism right now

train_pid_3418,"Why is it that talking to people about depression is so hard? : Heyo everyone. I'm usually a chipper person outwardly in my day-to-day life. It's all a facade, of course, but I feel like a lot of folks with depression do the same. I'm constantly telling people to be positive, giving career advice, and overall trying to be a decent person for my wife, kids, and co-workers (not my friends, as I have literally none since I graduated college).

Keeping with that, why do I have such a problem talking to my wife about my depression? I feel stupid for complaining about my anxiety over money, debt, and bills. I feel like I'm just bitching when I complain about having to work from home because of a sleep disorder I have. I know I'm a hypocrite when I say ""I need to lose weight"" and then just have absolutely no motivation to actually do it. I whinge about how much my job makes me want to just kill myself but then stick with it because ""It pays the bills."" 

I just make excuses for everything and whinge about everything which leads to me just trying to keep it inside instead. My doctor told me the other day that my sleep apnea (not the disorder I mentioned, that's another one) is extremely severe because I'm so overweight; why don't I just lose the weight? I couldn't bring myself to answer with ""because I'm an unmotivated fat fuck that values my life less than I value the brief happiness I get from drinking soda.""

It's behaviour that we know is self-destructive and I don't want to think I'm the only person that keeps everything bottled up. It leads to days where I'm just really on edge and I feel like even more of a burden than I usually do. The only reason I keep going is because my family needs me for money at this point.

I just wanted a forum where I could whine some without being judged too harshly. Cheers.",1

train_pid_2792,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",1
train_pid_4855,"Why do I care what people think? : I don't want to care what people think, I don't want to feel the hurt anymore. I moved to the US from Spain when I was eight.

I am nineteen now, I dropped out of highschool due to the never ending loop of anxiety and depression. I've quit two jobs so far and training for a new job starts next week.

Today, I had a particularly bad day, I opened up to a friend about my problems with trusting and bonding with new people. I also contacted the girl who took my virginity, which I haven't done in almost a year. I called her and she was at work waiting for her ride home. I guess she was with a co-worker or something because she started talking about how I dropped out of high school. Then she asked me if I'm going to college, and I told her I don't know. She was telling me to stop being 'pricky', I literally said nothing to offend her and she just has to go and restate the fact that I didn't graduate. Gee thanks for reminding me that I'm a fucking loser, I didn't know.

train_pid_8415,"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.

My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it.

I also go through phases of just really wanting friends/boyfriend/company and feeling really alone. Then that phase passes after a week or two and i feel like i just want to be alone and that i dont want or need anyone else. then the cycle repeats. i have no idea why.

train_pid_8495,"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. 

I think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.",2

It's the feeling that now I'm completely at the mercy of the pharmaceutical industry and the next Martin Shkreli type of scumbag can decide to raise the price astronomically at any moment just because he feels like it. I feel like I have to be thankful to some piece of shit pharmaceutical company execs just for not deciding to bankrupt people like us.
Also that if there is a significant disruption in the modern supply chain that all industrialized places rely on, tough shit! Time to go cold turkey! I know that depression isn't an actual illness that can kill you by itself so it's not the best comparison, but the reason so many people in Puerto Rico died from Hurricane Maria wasn't because of drowning or being crushed by rubble, it was because they ran out of their medication or power for the devices that kept them alive.
I hate that I need meds to function. It makes me feel pathetic and dependent on a system that I hate with every fiber of my being. And I hate knowing that had I been born in literally any other era or even most places in the world today I'd be dead by now.

Life feels robotic. Living feels mechanical and draining. The ritualistic process carried from one day to another. Lately, the tampering sadness in me is starting to swallow me alive. Routines set for healthy habits turns into empty altruism. I feel empty. Listening to most songs can overrun my mind, bringing back the old cherishing memories I’ve taken for granted. I can’t help but miss the sweet, simple childhood I’ve had but was taken for granted. Daring to reach adulthood only to feel at a loss with life and all it has to offer. I’ve only reached the first steps of adulthood but have never felt more strained and overwhelmed as each day passes. Forcing myself to get up, make the bed, and distracting myself through self-made chores have became numbly overbearing. All the energy I’ve pushed towards every hour of the day starts to drain quicker as days began to pass and months start to slip. Here, a new year. Another round of my robotic lifestyle.

train_pid_1172,Waiting for it to just end. : I was diagnosed 2 years ago with an illness that quite frankly isn't that bad in some but horrible in others and I got the shit end of that stick. I was trying to pull my life together everything was looking better I wasn't as depressed as I use to be and then everything went to shit. I honestly wanted to die the second I found out because I knew it was going to make getting my life together harder. But I didn't realise it was going to in a sense end it. But I kept trying because even as screwed as I thought I was I didn't really know how bad it was going to get and I saw my family really cared for me and I didn't want to hurt them so I fought.I went from being physically in the best shape of my life to being unable to walk to my bathroom on somedays without feeling drained. I'm in horrible pain everyday I went from never smoking anything to smoking weed almost daily as to bring down the pain a bit. My mind has been destroyed not by the weed but by the drugs that were used earlier in my illness when I was on them I went from being able to do calculus to having issues adding. My memory went to shit and even almost a year and a half later I'm not even half of what I use to be mentally.8 or 9 months ago I was told by my doctor that this disease is going to kill me and they no longer want to give me medication for it as it has done little to help me. I hope every single time I go to sleep I won't wake up. Everytime I allow myself to think I just imagine what I could have nothing amazing but something. I catch myself occasionally forgetting I can't do those things I want to do. Nights when I can't sleep from the pain I just wish for this to end. I've been to therapy got sent to psychiatric hospital after my 3rd surgery because I can't take this. The hospital made things much worse mentally. I've told people that my doctor says that I will die to this illness and surviving this long makes me feel like a liar. I don't know when this will kill me but my doctor said he'd be surprised if I had 5 years that is far to long. I'm not angry at the world I'm not upset I'm just done. I just want to sleep and never wake up I'm not alive I'm just existing at this point.

In 2019 the company I work for has gone through a big transition from small company to bigger player in the field. A few of our senior workers didn’t like the change so I’ve stepped up (by my own choice, my bosses are actually fantastic and would never ask) and worked longer hours and weekends to keep everything going. I’m up for a huge promotion next year because of it.


Towards the end of the year I noticed I was getting more tired and snappy so I booked a long break over Christmas where we’d normally shut down, assuming it was exhaustion. Now I’m off I feel like it’s gotten worse. 


Spending time with people annoys me, I don’t find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven’t left the house or showered for a week because I haven’t needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.


I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn’t want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.


I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t know what I’m going to do.

I don’t know why I’m here, I’m usually not one to show any emotion, or ask for help, I’ve always been mild and even tempered. Lately I’ve really been struggling though, I deleted my social media’s weeks ago, due to negative interactions, before that I ditched long running games I’d played on my phone, the idea behind that was so that I could focus more time on my family without distractions. I had a drastic shift change at work and I knew time with them was going to be at a premium already and I didn’t want meaningless things taking away from them. My wife struggles with her own anxiety and depression, I don’t want to lump mine on to hers when I don’t full understand it myself, even though to a certain degree I already do, I removed familiar comfort distractions and I never replaced them with constructive creative outlets like I intended. I cut out the empty but never replaced it with anything meaningful, the things that distracted me from the monotony are gone, but all I have right now is the monotonous day in day out. I know my wife sees it, she’s called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I’m tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained. More than anything I think I just needed to say this, if only to try and shake myself out of apathy.",1

All my friends betrayed me th girl that i feel in love 2 years ago is now in a relationship with a good friend of mine. 
My bestfriend betrayed me because some false rumors about me literally everybody switched on me because some junkie told shit about me being a snitch and snitching on him and dealing with the guy who ripped him, but i wasn't even there i had nothing to with.
So what happend its that the guy that spread the false rumors got ripped in a deal for pills (alot of pills like 3 thousand ecstasy pills), so that guy reached out to me so i can provide him pills because i was the plug. So i thought you know what if everybody switched on me im gonna switch on them too so i started dealing with this guy and apparently some guy in the group of the client still talks with the guy that spread the rumors and (we were good friends with that guy but he got heavy on drugs doing heroin, meth..) he called like im gonna kill you this and that i didnt got scared but i felt good because he owed me alot of money and i felt like: ""ok now that guy is out from my life"" i felt a relieve but then he started lying to all my friends and they believed him.
Later i came to the city where all my friends were and i asked my best friend to come and smoke a joint with and talk a bit i was gonna tell him the truth and chat with him but was still paranoid. Then i told him to come to this place but i wasnt exacly at that place i was like in the other street watching if he would come alone, i was a bit high and then i thought: ""oh come on he is my best friend he wouldn't betray me""  and i went to the place and waited a couple minutes then i saw him coming with 2 guys more and they didnt look too friendly luckily they didn't see me, i ran i ran so fast and didnt look back they was up to something i remmeber that they had brass knuckles and knifes allways, i can fight im not scared to fight but they probably had knifes and they were three guys. 
I ran then i stoped i smoked a cigarette and felt so bad i didnt cry but that hurted me my best friend betrayed me, he asked me on messenger ""where are you?"" i left it on seen then he blocked me i really felt so bad i had nightmares for weeks about killing my friends, like shooting them or poisioning them.
That was like a month ago, but then i see on facebook that this girl i felt really in love with her i loved her to death i saw her status: ""in relationship with...""  I was like damn fuck me a good friend of mine see was with him when i used to go to party with her and hanging out with her she claimed to be a lesbian and she said thats why i cant be with you she claimed that she got raped and she couldnt be with guys. I cried for her did alot of drugs because of her, when i saw her for the last time she said she didnt have much money i used to deal small amounts of drugs back then i emptied my pocked and showed her my dirty money and offered her money then she said: ""oh you are so childish.."" that broke my heart she was 21 and i was a kid 17 years old i really wanted her i gave up on everybody for her...
I remmember we kissed in her room till 4 am we almost had sex but she said that she was scared so i said sorry and felt sad she said that we could be friends i said i should be going my mom is waiting for me she hugged me and i left in my moped i cried all the way home. Then 2 years later i see this i felt like shit she wants a bigger guy that can protect her and take for her but back i was i kid in her eyes..
That was it guys everything is going wrong with my life. Well theres a couple of thing that are ok like im getting my driving license these day that is the only positive thing in my life right now but yeah i still feel like shit",0

train_pid_2010,"I totally lost it at the very beggining of 2020 :  

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

Joking...

over the summer, i eventually got over her (minus the exception where i dreamed about her and got sad for a week).

she texted me in november asking me how things were going. emotions came flooding back. the only thing was that she was being extremely flaky, sometimes taking up to a week to respond to my texts. why even text me if you’re going to play “hard to get”?

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do.

I'm in horrible pain everyday I went from never smoking anything to smoking weed almost daily as to bring down the pain a bit. My mind has been destroyed not by the weed but by the drugs that were used earlier in my illness when I was on them I went from being able to do calculus to having issues adding. My memory went to shit and even almost a year and a half later I'm not even half of what I use to be mentally.8 or 9 months ago I was told by my doctor that this disease is going to kill me and they no longer want to give me medication for it as it has done little to help me. I hope every single time I go to sleep I won't wake up. Everytime I allow myself to think I just imagine what I could have nothing amazing but something. I catch myself occasionally forgetting I can't do those things I want to do. Nights when I can't sleep from the pain I just wish for this to end. I've been to therapy got sent to psychiatric hospital after my 3rd surgery because I can't take this. The hospital made things much worse mentally. I've told people that my doctor says that I will die to this illness and surviving this long makes me feel like a liar. I don't know when this will kill me but my doctor said he'd be surprised if I had 5 years that is far to long. I'm not angry at the world I'm not upset I'm just done. I just want to sleep and never wake up I'm not alive I'm just existing at this point. I go through the motions of day to day life I don't seem depressed on the outside I make the same jokes about it like I use to as a way to show my friends I'm fine but honestly I'm not.,1

train_pid_702,"Jeez, looking back at the decade is horribly depressed. From 15 to 25, almost NOTHING changed for the good. : I believe I dropped out of high school when I was 15 or 16, not sure when. I got my GED instead then that was it. 

Slowly but surely lost all my friends over that time, but somehow got a girlfriend during that time whom I've been with for almost 7 years now. Sometimes I feel I put too much dependency on her. 

Anyway, I just feel that at my age I should be somewhere else. I still live with my dad, I never went to college, I don't have friends, I've lost all social skills I used to have. Any time I'm around people (which is really fucking rare) I shut down and can't connect so I stay inside like always. 

This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do. 

I don't know, I just feel fucking old and like I'm wasting my youth.  

I want to make this next decade better, I'm optimistic but I can't help look at the past and wonder what could have been.",1

train_pid_1630,"Christmas Noose : Impending like a noose reliant upon the slightest pinch of gravity, Christmas came, descending the world and everything in it to the brink of the obsolete. I had just come home from being abroad for 16 months; a trip one would hope and expect to be tickled pink with engaging stories and comedy, wisdom and knowledge to be shared. but i was depleted, and the expectation of this hearty social spiel put me off ease. I had come to witness and suffer a lot about myself in the past months, a personal revelation of sorts.
and it's nothing new this sort of thing, but this time my self inflicting alienation was pushed to the brink of possibly no return.
Now factor in relationships of mixed dynamics, uncertain and weary groundings and my vulnerability to inevitable triggers, you have my worst major depression of my adult years.
Family burst through the doors as joy flooded the halls alike the day Christ walked the earth. All sin and past troubles forgiven, personal strife and habitual feuds overcome. Tensions in themselves silenced while penance was dealt and checked; for this one last Hurrah of the year, together we'll ring in the bells. The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake.

23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first.

That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. 
All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath.  My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time.
The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth.
Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. 
There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more.

As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more. The Will to surrender to the hand up above, who provides tremendous shelter and pushes you forth. The memory of humour and Soloman's song, the play shall wait for you to accept your part.",1

train_pid_435,How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,1

Obviously this made me go off the rails, so after consulting my therapist, I went back to taking the pills but started off at 25mg for two weeks and then went up to 50mg. My therapist said it didn't sound like I needed to up my dosage anymore. Then I had a good few weeks and stupidly thought I didn't need the pills again anymore. So again I stopped taking them. Now I'm regretting that decision. I have an appointment with my therapist in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime I am wondering if I should start again with 50mg or start the process over again with 25mg.

train_pid_2029,"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

train_pid_3417,"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, ""Just make new friends!"" but that's not how it works. I can't just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would've made new friends a long time ago. Anyways... thanks for reading",1

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that.

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life.

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

Now to me, that seems to imply that caring for a baby is easier than his job. Well it's not, and it's pretty much driving me into the deep end and I want to hurt myself. I've cried with such anger that I dug my fingernails into my flesh causing pain and at the same time relief that I could feel it.

I'm only writing this because I have no where else to vent and get off my chest. I'm beginning to wonder if the ones who experience depression are meant to so they would eventually take their lives to trim the human population since we really don't have a natural predator to maintain population.. but then again, we are our own predator since we kill off each other through wars, difference of opinion, and just plain stupidity.
That's another thing that upsets me. There are way too many people inventing shit that they feel is justified and then push it on others when they don't agree. We don't even abide the laws of nature, instead we corrupt it and even laugh at it. When I was younger, everything was awesome and never had to deal with the social problems that are going on now. I mean, where the fuck did that even come from!? It makes me sick and hate living surrounded by that shit, I don't even watch TV because it disgusts me too much. I don't want to live any longer having to deal with it .. it's too much wasted energy.

train_pid_4077,"I've never felt so down or broken before. I really hate life. : I really miss my parents. My dad died almost 26 years ago when I was 13. I loved hanging out with him at work. He showed me so much. Every young person needs a dad like him. It was so devastating when he died. The doctors kept telling me he was going to be alright. I was just a kid. I didn't know better. It blind sided me when he died. My mom slipped into a deep depression. A couple of years after that she walked out on me. I lived a long time alone before I reconnected with her. I can remember my friends getting birthday presents, being with family at Thanksgiving. It was an insane feeling getting used to just being alone. There were a few girlfriends but nothing serious. It's proven impossible to find a woman that will love me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last year of my mom's life I was dating what I thought was the love of my life. When my mom got sick and was hospitalized I needed someone to talk to. I called my girlfriend at the time but she wouldn't pick up her phone. Didn't respond to texts. It didn't take long to figure out she was cheating on me. It was a crazy situation. She was messing around with a married guy and the guy's wife spray panted my now exgirlfriend's car. Police were calling and there was a lot to deal with. Shortly after my mom died I received an audio file. Someone recorded my ex-girlfriend talking on the phone with someone about how she didn't want to deal with me and my mom's death. That she didn't have the time and better things to do. It was unbelievable how cold. I buried my mother alone. The time I should have been spending with my mom I was talking to the police until they figured out who was harassing my exgirlfriend. She destroyed the mourning time I should have had for my mother. This is something that I was carry with me for the rest of my life. 

This was a year and a half ago. I've been alone ever since. I've lost my sex drive and have nothing but contempt for dating. I've been in therapy but to be honest I don't think it working for me. I think this situation isn't what most therapists deal with. Someone that's been alone like I have and lost what I have probably isn't fixable. 

I got a text recently from my exgirlfriend. She was begging me to meet her somewhere so she could apologize. I blocked the new number she texted me from. I don't want to see or hear from her again. 

I have moments when I want to get out there and meet someone. I'll even go as far as to create a dating profile or go out where single people hang out. But when I look at women I just see this unreliable thing that's just going to hurt me. I'm just reminded of my failures in dating and how every girl that's been with me just wanted to find someone else with complete disregard to my feelings. It would be different if things just didn't work out. If I could get a ""Sorry but this isn't working for me"" speech. That you can't argue with. That you can get over. 

I've never felt this broken or sad. I feel like since she cheated on me while my mom was dying in the hospital then who can you trust? Now it's too late. When I needed someone the most they screwed me over. The world had it's chance to impress me with it's compassion but it showed me how horrible people can be instead.",1

train_pid_5436,"I want to kill two people that were once my friends(Long) : This is kinda long, but I want to get it out. I grew a pretty decent friend group in college, as I was pretty outspoken in class. We'd have get together's at my place, go to movies, and have LAN parties, usual nerdy college friend stuff. I liked them all, but I grew the closest to one I'll call Duke. Duke was the most level guy I knew, and was a good solid ground if I got too depressed. He was at my house nearly everyday, a lot of the time even slept over, my place was basically a second house to him. I soon realized he was the best thing in my life. 10 months ago he died in a car crash.

&amp;#x200B;

The two people I want to kill were in the friend group. They're a couple, I'll call them Adam and Jesse. My problems with them started two years ago, me and Adam shared the same job, so we'd see each other a lot and became closer as friends. I think that closeness is what started me realizing they're weren't good people. One time on break I asked if they could clean their house and if I could help, he responded by threatening to kill me, then Jesse texted me saying I was an asshole and never to insult them again. Mind you, it wasn't just 'Day old McDonalds cups sitting around', a closer definition would be some of the rooms on NeckbeardNests, but the whole house. I'll add that I'm really bad at confrontation, so not wanting to lose them as friends and feeling bad that I insulted them I offered to pay for books that Jesse needed for school, Adam had brought up that they were always low on money and didn't have enough for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I got a girlfriend, a friend of Jesse's. But for me, managing work and a girlfriend wasn't possible at the time. It ended on a day I was feeling super down, I was staying the night at her place and couldn't sleep because I was so upset, gf didn't like that and and we had an argument all night, me trying to explain it wasn't her fault I was depressed, and her claiming she knows what I'm doing, ""Just using depression to run away from problems"". She broke up with me a few days later over text. In that time I tried to get advice form Jesse and Adam on how to handle things and, admittedly, validate how I feel. I was expecting Jesse to be to be somewhat defensive since she was her friend, but was incredibly upset at me. Being already in a state of depression, their lack of compassion toward how I felt hit me hard. I lost my job and lost contact with them after Adam threatened to kill me if I didn't stop talking to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to 10 months ago. A bit before Duke died I'd been trying to reconnect with Adam and Jesse, stupid yeah, but I'm a stubbornly caring guy, so stuff like that bothers me. And then it happened, a few hours later I was at the hospital and got a call from Jesse, saying that her and Adam ""loved"" me and that they're sorry about Duke. A few days later I suggested that all us in the friend group hang out, just to shoot the s\*\*\*. Since Duke was usually at my place, it would've brought up memories, so we decided to have it at Adam and Jesse's. I was supposed to be happy seeing everyone again and hanging out, but I just couldn't get over how A and J they treated me. Knowing they wouldn't apologize or bring it up I just left. I got a text from Jesse, ""We should just forget about it, move on"", I took that as ""We don't want to take responsibility for being terrible"". Later they'd agreed to go see a movie and invited me, I said screw and went, maybe I could just look past it, but in the lobby, in front of the rest of my friends in front of several people Jesse basically told me again, ""Move on, forget what happened in the past. Being un-confrontational I silently agreed and we all watched the movie, the whole time I was mulling over how they were acting, and how they got all of the rest of the friend group to side with them. It really burned.

&amp;#x200B;

After the movie I had to drive, I usually did it to get my mind off things, but it didn't help. I'd just lost the guy I could call my best friend, almost a brother, and these two were still doing they're underhanded, manipulative games. I went to their house, knocked on the door and told them that we needed to sort this out in person, the three of us sit down and talk about stuff, I just wanted to get that closure. Later I git a lot of hate texts from the other friends, ""You gave Jesse a panic attack"", ""She's super scared"". Adam told me to never talk to them again and filed a restraining order. So everyone thinks I'm a crazed lunatic and have no way to convince my other friends otherwise. I was alone at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to the Duke's funeral. I hadn't spoken to anyone for a few weeks before it, so I came in pretty angered, but what pushed me over the edge was seeing Adam and Jesse outside the church laughing with my other friends. I know it wasn't at Duke or at me, but seeing them happy after all the things they did and how I felt just broke me. I didn't talk to anyone at the funeral, didn't make eye contact, just sat there in a rage crumpling the funeral pamphlet in my hand. I was walking out and stopped at his car, just stared at it for a while then kicked in the rearview mirror and kicked some dents into the door, they came outside as I was walking off, called Jesse and Adam harsh names. I 100% admit that that wasn't the right choice, it scarred Duke's family and most likely cemented in my other friend's mind that I was crazy, but dammit if it wasn't the most satisfied I felt in a long time. I got an arrest warrant, had to pay $300, and I'm still on probation for a few months. I didn't go to the court hearing, I knew if I saw them again I'd fly off again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I've cut ties with all my friends that didn't cut them with me, even with my mom who, in my eyes, was in defense of Adam and Jesse. I don't trust people, and can't stand the thought of making new friends or any other relationship. Added on to that, Everytime I see their actual names, see someone's face in a movie that vaguely looks like theirs, see someone getting married, are boyfriend of girlfriend, or see any Halo related(Adam was a huge fan), or any other number of small insignificant things that vaguely remind if them I get in a terrible mood. I've lost days of sleep to that, sometimes a few in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

I've convinced myself that the only way to get closure to any of this is to hurt them, and since I've been alone with my thoughts for a while hurt has turned into considering murder. I think I'd actually do it if anything else traumatic happens in my life, like I'd just become dead to how others feel. I would not care about the consequences. I've already convinced myself that my death would be a little consequence, it would save money, and my family is emotionally distant. The only things stopping me is the well-being of my dog, who's 17, and funnily enough The Last of Us 2. I had a therapist but like I said, I can't trust people. But I am on depression medication.

train_pid_3111,Anyone else having the weirdest alternatives to suicide? : [removed],1
train_pid_8510,"I never feel like I'm doing enough and I'm worried I'm going to be a failure. : I'm a 20 year old guy working about 25-35 hours a week for minimum wage in food services. I'm going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa. My plan is to become a highschool teacher and I'm making decent progress towards it. This is about the only thing that I can tell myself for reassurance when I really start to feel down though. Still, it will take me 4 years (1 1/2 more) of community college to get the associates and the 90 units I need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher, and I feel like that makes me seem weak. Especially since you're supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years. 

Now to explain the insecurities I have, I guess ill start with my weight. I think being a fat kid really messes with your development. Not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool. I lost 100 pounds before my senior year and I'm still chubby 3 years down the road. 
I just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long. I'm about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat. I do go running up hills and/or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day. Still I offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day. With all that's going on in my life I wish I could just accept my current weight and say I'm healthy, but I'm not that attractive because of it. I have a lot of weight on my stomach and I have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off. My body makes me cringe when I look at it and I constantly am thinking about how gross I probably look. With all the other shit going on in my life I just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day I already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when I was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day. I'm hungry 24/7 and it hurts when people tell me I just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up. 

As far as my face goes, I'm like an average 7/10 or so. I can't really complain about it even though I could look a lot nicer. I am told I look like a 16 year old a lot.

Another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis. It's right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and I worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me. I know everyone is different, I just hope that the girls I'm attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much. 

The combination of extra weight, female breast tissue, a bit of a baby face, and being 6'0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it. 

As far as hobbies go I play guitar regularly and I do slowly achieve goals I set for it. Still, I dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it. I used to be really good at piano but I stopped playing when my mom died. Music in general is the only reason I'm still alive as corny as that sounds. It's my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic. Although guitar can do a good job distracting me, I dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room. 

In highschool I was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life. I can't say for sure, but I theorize that I did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax, opiates, and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time, washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup. I was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned, didn't believe in depression. I self medicated and self-destructed for a while until something interesting happened. I asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me. My initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and I just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana. I think I wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind I was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser. 

Eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me PTSD for about a year. I was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because I was having flashbacks from the massive doses of LSD I had done. It took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time. 

At this point I've never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me. I have strong requirements that any girl I date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl I end up marrying. Why would I date someone who I know my relationship wont work out with? One girl initially seemed great, but as we talked more, I realized her values were different from mine and that's the closest I've been to being in a relationship. Most girls, it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out. I find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that I like conservative minded women, but I'm not christian and not exactly conservative. I have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity, meeting in the middle. A decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life. 
A lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys, not planning for the future, going to festivals etc... I wouldn't set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls. 

I want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me, that would build me up and be a positive force in my life , but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears. I think I'm a very exceptional person. Which doesn't mean I'm great but that I fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad. This seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something I'm quite adept at, especially for an introvert. 

I write all of this out of loneliness and fear. I want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from, and I'm worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around.

 I know I might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly. Along with occasional paranoia and panic, and sometimes I just go completely numb. You see, I have really bad depression but I try not to let it define me and I dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness. So I've laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes, I am depressed and I am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis.",2
train_pid_7407,"I don’t like who I’m becoming : So just a bit of context.
So I’m a third year university student and last December I had to have surgery on my lower back. It was a pretty big surgery so I missed around 1 month of school to recover. But during those weeks I was alone pretty much everyday and stuck in bed all day because I couldn’t move properly. The best part of my day was seeing the nurses and doctors for post surgery care because I could finally talk to someone, someone who cared. It was the most loneliest time in my life because most of my friends were busy with finals and I was just alone with my thoughts. So I started over analyzing a lot of things and hate myself for missing classes and finals. I know that what happen was out of my control but I keep feeling like this was punishment for something I did. 
When I came back to school for the next semester I realized a lot of people didn’t even realize that I missed a month of school. And these are people that I’ve know for two years, we all know each other in my program because there’s only 60 of us. I feel like if people don’t notice that I’m gone for a month, they never really cared about me at all. My friends told me that everyone was just busy with finals so no one was really paying attention to anything but themselves. But I still feel like no one cares about me and I dealing with everything on my own. After that I started to notice that I genuinely hate everyone. I hate seeing other people laughing and smiling with other people. I deserve to be happy too. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends because I realized that they only ever talked to me if they needed anything. I tried talking to one of my friends about my whole situation and she said I was just being dramatic. I stopped talking to her about myself after that.
But now I’m starting to realize that I’m changing. I will spend the entire day without saying a word or talk to anyone. I hate seeing other people be happy. I want them to be in the same situation as me. I keep looking at people and hoping something bad happens to them. I never thought like before. I started drinking before I go to bed because I can’t sleep anymore. I used to love my program and going to school. But now when ever I hate even entering the building and see people in my program. I stopped caring about things. I don’t care about school, or my life or about me. I have no motivation at all do anything. I used to have my life together and now everything is a mess.
I don’t like who I am right know. I really want to go back to who I was. But I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

train_pid_5302,"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. 

I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.

She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. 

My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.

I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",1

train_pid_1705,"I have a habit of ghosting people, even if I really like them : I’m perceived by others as happy-go-lucky (exactly how my only friend outside of my family words it), and outgoing. It’s not a conscious front or personality that I fake, it’s just what naturally comes out around others. My depression is generally undetectable if you don’t already know me.

But I’ve noticed a pattern in myself. 
I (accidentally) make acquaintances quite easily, and I seem to 9 times out of 10 regret establishing some form of contact with them. I have an undeniable sense of dread whenever my phone rings.
I try my best to push through what seems to be commitment issues, but after a while, I’ll dissolve our connection. It usually has nothing to do with how the person acts. I feel like a terrible person, and a very bad friend. Once in a while I’ll reach out and say hi, but I don’t like constantly hanging out.

The worst part is that I don’t know how to explain it. I am perfectly happy being alone, and I even prefer being alone most times. I can’t ever seem to word it properly as an explanation to why I’m so hard to get ahold of, and when I do, I just come off as super weird. It’s completely uncharacteristic of how I am when I’m in direct contact with someone, which I try to avoid at all costs.

tl;dr: I wanna know if anyone can relate to disassociating with good people for no clear reason. Am I just being overly critical of myself?",1

train_pid_172,"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",1

train_pid_4290,"How do I know if I have depression? : I’m confused because I display symptoms of depression such as a loss in motivation for some activities, wanting to nap constantly (never took naps before), less of an appetite, feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, can’t catch a break, will never be good enough, despair. Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. 

I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset.

train_pid_5750,"How do I know if I should seek help : Around January last year I started to feel really down and lost most motivation I had going in life. I was a straight A student and always had such a strong drive to do well and within the span of a few months everything came crashing down for me. I lost all motivation, could barely get out of bed in the morning and either felt apathetic or just sad. I rarely genuinely laugh anymore and my happiness feels like something I project to the world rather then an actual feeling. I went through a few periods like that before everything fell apart but it never stuck around except the summer before for a whole month I just went apathetic. Since then it’s just stuck around, sometimes it’s easier and I can manage but some days I can barely make it through the school day without being on the verge of tears. I knew I had some mild anxiety problems before that so I just blamed it on that but it feels a bit different. Honestly when it started I resorted to sh, sometimes for stress relief, sometimes just to feel something. I’m a few months clean now but the pressure has been getting overwhelming and it’s hard not to again. Ive gone through periods of drinking to make the feeling go away too but I’ve been staying away from that so far. I’ve started skipping classes really bad and occasionally just not going and telling everyone I’m sick cause it just feel awful. I’ve been told it’s just teenage hormones and shit and a bunch of other stuff but when I go on here and talk to others with those issues I feel I share similar feelings but often for them it’s cause of depression but as for me I don’t know. I don’t want to be one of those cases where I just seem like an attention seeker or such or like I’m overreacting I’m just not sure what to do. Is it a possibility?

And I was after losing my last place at the Uni did I really evaluate my life, so I ditched that horrible toxic group in a real world that was making me feel absolutely shitty, the superficial conversations and completely bunked turning up to Jim’s Cafe. I didn’t feel like a huge loss at hurt me it felt like a relief and one less problem to deal with. I had a lovely couple of months being indoors which suited my own personality and what I wanted in life, got back into music, writing and soon began see a positives.

I then started making goals for myself, my first goals were to get up every morning so I did, I then I quit sugar and that made things easier and began exercising.  Then I started thinking what I wanted to do so, so I applied for my degree in social work and within weeks in, I was actually a student and doing something meaningful and productive again.

My ups didn’t last long as student fiancé had messed up my passport and literally a few days before the end of the term gather a years a terms, and this time I wasn’t that backing down leave part way through the year, self resilience and determination got me through that bump and thankfully the fees were sorted student finance admitted their mistakes I can finally see things getting slightly better

Then on the 16th December I got the call that my uncle lost his short battle with cancer and ended up having a very scaled down Christmas, didn’t feel like putting on Xmas films as I was upset and in shock, to this I’m still in this numb place and then add extra pressure I didn’t pass my first exam and that really pushed things right into the dark place. I was already upset that my uncle had passed away at 65 and this really pushed my back into self destructive ways .

train_pid_4956,"Am I Depressed Or Just Lonely? : Whenever I’m alone at work or in public I have these moments where I feel sad, almost pathetic. I feel like a piece of crap honestly. I feel like I’m unappreciative of what I have and selfish for having suicidal thoughts. I know my family cares but it’s hard to talk to them about personal shit like my feelings and whatnot. 

I feel as if I need a distraction. I get no sleep because once I put down the phone thought come back to my head. Thoughts about my boring ass pathetic life are always in my mind but it helps when I watch YouTube or play video games or Go on reddit since I have no friends and no life. 

It is tiring, how long I have to stay up. I’m either awake till around 7am each night from trying to distract myself or I’m up that late from crying/thinking about my crap life.",1
train_pid_2705,Where to go from here : I’ve been battling depression for almost 6 years. Some days are better than other but for the past year it feels like it’s getting worse by the day. I recently did something I now vary much regret. I helped my closest “friend” break into a veterinarian office to steal drugs(ketamine). I didn’t think he’d do it but now I have to pay the price. I should have told him no. I didn’t say no because he’s the closest thing I have to a friend these days. This feels like rock bottom but every time I think it’s rock bottom it’s not. Where do I go from here?,1
train_pid_8736,"My suicide attempt : I never realized it till now but I should have been hospitalized many times in my past. I have attempted suicide 5 times and failed every. single. time.  With every attempt, I have gotten closer to not waking up but still haven’t found the perfect concoction. I usually drink too much wine and then take somewhere between 15-30 pills of over the counter sleeping pills. I started with 10 pills thinking that that would be enough and now I’m up to 30 pills. Next time I’ll try 50. The last time I tried, the next day I’m usually very out of it and have a hard time functioning but I usually can make it through the day. I should be going to the ER but I never do because I don’t want them to think I’m doing it for attention. So, I just go about my day hoping that nobody will ask too many questions. If I go to the ER for a suicide attempt, I know that I will be put on a 24hr hold to be properly assessed by a mental health professional and I don’t want that because I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I don’t want people to think I’m mentally sick because of the stigmas. I’ve gotten so much negative feedback anytime I open up to people. They usually tell me to get over it because they think I’m faking it and that my feelings aren’t valid. I don’t want to be seen as trying to get attention. It would be hard for me to accept that I’m actually sick. I don’t think I deserve the help but yet I’m so prepared to kill myself. When is the time to reach out and how do I help myself. I’m so stuck right now. Even after seeing a therapist, I didn’t know what to say when I was in therapy so for the most part it was just three 50mins sessions of ya sitting in silence because I couldn’t define why I was there. Eventually I just stopped showing up and now I have no hope that there’s help for me. The meds I was put on didn’t work and I was put on 3 different types...maybe I am making this all up but yet I still would rather just kill myself than live a miserable life that involves me faking all of my emotions because I don’t know what they really feel like anymore. It’s driving me mad and I think I’m going to attempt a 6th attempt soon. Hopefully this time it will work.",2

train_pid_3956,"My partner ridiculed my depression-related eating and sleeping habits : This morning my partner had a serious discussion with me about the way I eat, and he also mentioned my sleeping patterns as well. He just noticed that my day-to-day habits aren’t very healthy, but the way he brought it up really rubbed me the wrong way. I know he is trying to express concern and caring, but all he said basically was that I should “improve.” What am I supposed to do with that advice? 

I explained that these habits are attached to a more deep-seated problem and he understood that, but I still think he was so insensitive to just bring up a complicated issue and say I need to be better. He got to comment on it and then just put on his coat and leave, whereas I’m left to deal with the reality that I’m failing as a human and other people are noticing. 

I’m trying my best and I’ve improved slowly but surely in the past few months, and I don’t know why he couldn’t focus on the positive instead of the negative. I told him to be more supportive rather than to just throw common-sense blanket suggestions at me. He walked out on me in the end, because he thought I was being difficult.",1

Fighting depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and OCD through college was hard, I gave up twice, I wasn't efficient and everything I used to love turned into a big burden. I tried therapy and several meds with no success, I had the worst episode of depression the last year and changed my meds again, I found some relief but every time I though about me and my mental illnesses I saw myself weak and defeated. 
But today, ooh today... I feel like I won this endless battle and even though I know that I still need to work a lot on my mental health I feel like I can do it and I don't care if I'm 1.5 years late, I don't care if everything I make in life will take me longer than usual. I have been fighting everyday for myself, choosing to be alive and vital and even though it doesn't bring me happiness always it does bring me some moments of joy like this one, moments that I can share with the people that I love and have seen me in my worst and helped me through. 
And since reading you have helped me to understand myself more, to not feel lonely, to know that it is possible to keep moving even when it looks like it is the end for us, I wanted to share this with you, cause success means nothing to me if not shared.

train_pid_7172,"It’s impossible for me to not rely on the company of other people to keep me “happy”. : Hi all, female in her late teens, here. There’s a TLDR (too long didn’t read it) at the end of this post for the short and summed up version, but for more details, read the full post if possible. Thanks &amp; i hope you’re all having a good day :) 

So, I know everyone always says not to rely on others for happiness, but I find it literally impossible. I have hardly any friends anyways, but when I have a falling out with one of them or if I get ghosted by someone I develop a “friendship” with online etc, I fall into the worst state of depression for DAYS. It sounds really sad, I know, but does anyone else have this same problem where you just feel like you can’t be happy or even feel decent without talking to friends or a romantic partner? Or any ideas on how to cope with feeling sad without having to rely on talking to my friends? I’ve gotten suggestions like play video games, go to the gym, read a book, etc as suggestions to keep myself occupied, but none of those really help me, unfortunately ): 

Also, another thing; how do some of you guys cope with being ghosted by someone that you really enjoyed talking to &amp; felt a connection with? For me it’s difficult to just get over it because I get attached to new people/friends suuuper easily and it sucks because internet friendships only really last so long for the most part before you either get ghosted entirely or just fall out of contact. It’s part of the whole “trying not to rely on others” thing for me, because when i get ghosted by someone it hurts and depresses the fuck outta me for a long ass time.

Any advice and or help would be much appreciated!
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. 

*TLDR: How should I try and cope with not feeling so depressed without relying on talking to friends to keep me “happy”? That’s usually the only thing that stops me from breaking down is talking to one of the (few) friends that I still have. Would appreciate some advice/suggestions. Thanks!*",0

I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more.

train_pid_3693,"Fuck this. : I’m using Siri to write this because I just don’t have the energy to write it myself. Everyone hates this holiday I’m not unique in thinking that. And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me. Just so you’re aware I have a history with severe depression and anxiety, this isn’t out of nowhere, although it is my first time posting about it so there is probably a lot of missing nuance and backstory. I’ll probably believe this at some point, but right now I truly just hate myself and everyone around me. Truly the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last few months has been my semi new puppy.

train_pid_151,I want to begin the long journey of breaking out of my depression. Any ideas on how to do this lads? : I’m tired of feeling this way and the start to a new decade is the perfect time to start the long process. Only problem is I don’t really know where to begin. Any ideas?,1
train_pid_8475,"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

It really makes me feel good though. It makes me feel invincible. I also am never very happy. I always feel that life would become too boring for me and that i would possibly end my life in my late 30s. I like to think like that though because i think its better than lying to myself. One more thing that bothers me is that i think alot of people around me are idiots but of course i cannot say thats true. Its not that they are not book smart, its that they dont think of the questions that really matter like what any of this was supposed to mean and what it means to exist. I would say that I dont think im smarter but i really do feel that way and i think its hurting the way i think about people and my life.

train_pid_334,Fuck New Years : Anyone else depressed by New Years.,1
train_pid_2667,"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn’t, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn’t push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that’s fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I’m cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there’s something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It’s easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don’t get me wrong It’s hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don’t fight what’s the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it’s also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I’ve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what’s stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I’m not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don’t use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I’m tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can’t outthink feelings. it’s time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. 

If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I’m tired of feeling and living this way and I’m sure I’m not the only one.",1

train_pid_3572,"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",1

train_pid_4001,"wanting to isolate myself : this will be a long boring rant about myself, u better get a drink to stay hydrated

two days ago i texted with a guy i have known a lil over a year because he had been drunk the day before. we tried being a couple for the most of that year but it didnt work because of different reasons, mainly long distance going hand in hand with jealousy.

when he was drunk he texted me as he often did that he was still in love with me. i was overwhelmed when he talked about not being able to forget me. i was flattered but also i felt angry. i was and still am angry at myself for ruining our relationship when we still had a chance to make it work. i am angry for loving him at times and sometimes not feel anything. im angry for flirting with him when i shouldnt have but couldnt control myself.

the next day we texted and i thought that i had to end it. i told him i was in love with someone else and he should get over me. he asked if i flirted with him out of pity and i said yes. i hurt him badly and told him we shouldnt talk anymore. we said goodbye and that was it.

ive never stopped feeling guilty for every single thing i did to him. whether it was me making a dumb joke that hurt him, me breaking up with him over something that we could have solved so easily, being mad for whatever stupid reason or almost giving up hope when things seemed to get harder. i was and am an idiot.

i am incredible insecure. i hated myself and my body since middle school came around and i always think i dont deserve peoples love and affection. the last year was really difficult and there were times where i just wanted to end it all. often he was almost the only one keeping me going and making me want to wake up.

he is incredible. hes sweet, cares for me, knows when somethings wrong, respected it when i didnt want to talk and just so much more. of course he wasnt perfect. he too had flaws, like being very jealous, sometimes a lil bitchy or being insecure about me not loving him.

i hurt one of the most important people in my life. i thought i deserved it. of course our friendship and relationship werent always just flowers and rainbows. we had our fights and for a period it was quite toxic for both of us. but we both changed in that year, we grew with each other. we hated the year 2019 but kept each other going. 

but now i ruined it. i destroyed the base. i told lies to hurt him and make him get away from me. i didnt and still dont deserve him. ive never felt this horrible before. 

on new years eve i got very drunk just to drown out the thoughts about him and celebrated with my family, but as soon as i was alone again, i started crying. i looked at new pictures on instagram where he celebrated and just stared at him smiling and laughing. i cant deal with the choices i made. people told me i would hurt less and that i made a step in the right direction, but i just know i didnt. 

a right decision wouldnt hurt this much. i want to apologize but i just cant. there is nothing i can say that would make things good again. nothing would be as it was before. he wont forgive for something so horrible. i wish i had the courage to text him this but it wouldnt change a thing about what happened. 

it hasnt even been a day since the year started and i already reached rock bottom. im just pathetic.",1

train_pid_2735,"Anyone else overcome with numbness? : I’m (32F) medicated for long-standing depression and anxiety. The medication is working, and I’m not suicidal. 

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. 

My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don’t want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn’t functioning. But I feel like I’m living a half-life, in a bubble where I am watching everything unfold but nothing is touching me.",1

You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation.

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",1
train_pid_4949,"Venting : I was in a relationship for 4 years and it ended last spring. I’m over it. It was the most serious I’d ever felt about someone. We just mutually agreed to break it off and go other directions. 

She helped me realize I go through spouts if depression and I need to handle it. So I am. 

I think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had. And now that it’s gone I feel empty. It’s not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just don’t work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her. 

Shortly after I moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that I had to leave. I explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it I wanted to have shipped. But she literally acted like I never mentioned that and just disposed of it all. 

I for the first time since I was a teenager cried my eyes out. I cried so hard. She sent me $150 as a sorry like that covered anything. My shoes, dress clothes... all gone. It was so personal. She will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it. She has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care. 

A few months went by after I moved out and she forgot my birthday. Didn’t even say anything until a few days after. Yet on her birthday literally 3.5 weeks after I moved out I acknowledged hers. Once again this destroyed me. A person who told me 100 times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close we’ve been for so long completely forgets I exist. 

These events have led me to resent her and I hate it. A month after I moved out she text that she was seeing someone. I thought wow... how fast. Then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy she’s seeing. How he had a daughter near the same age as mine. Making comparisons. .... okay. Now I get it. 

It’s easy to forget me and dispose of my things when you have the hots for a new guy. It made sense. And yet again I think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her? How can someone so easily dispose of another and be so blind to what they’re doing?

I’ve had the worst luck of my life since I moved away. I can’t even begin. None of you would believe it. All I can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better. This many bad things can’t keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed. Surely it has to end but here I am. 

I feel resentment and regret towards her now. I don’t want to. But it’s the actions after the ending. To this day she never realize how much I sacrificed and gave up to be with her. That I never fully recovered from. My depression won and back then I didn’t even realize it was depression. 

I wish I had never been in the Army either. That’s something else entirely. 

Today after 6 years a friend told me basically I am just one of many. Said I’m not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way. And I realized they were distancing themselves from me. What I felt about them was entirely different and I actually feel pain right now. Like I’m hurt and wounded. And I don’t know what to do anymore. 

My childhood was awful. Being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters. I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone about that. Just the beatings I took. My entire life has been violent. I’m disposable. I don’t have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother. Today I have realized I am truly alone. Hoping the tide goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive. Right now I’m stagnant and barely getting by. 

I think people use me until they’re no longer satisfied then dispose of me. I’m not even on a self pity trip. I think it’s just what it is and I’m coming to terms. I’ll never have the balls to end my own life. I just can’t do that. And sometimes I envy people that can. 

I don’t need any “hang in there” DMs or eye of the tiger speeches. I’m just venting. I don’t have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so I’m just saying what I have bottled inside. 

She could’ve said happy birthday. She made so many changes so fast right after I hit the door and here I was trying to be strong for her when really she could’ve counted my paces. My cat stays with her too. I miss my cat so bad. Just another thing I have to let go.",1

I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

Honestly, 2019 was probably the worst year of my life. It’s even worse thinking this year won’t be any different.

Everyone’s always hyped with their resolutions and goals, and I know most people would just say to do it “because it’ll make you feel better”, but what if I just simply don’t care? Or don’t have the motivation to? Why should I make goals or try to change when inevitably all I can really do is work my ass off for nothing just to survive? Isn’t that all life is anyway? Working to survive? How can you possibly “live” when responsibilities and the dark emptiness of adulthood hang over you like the cutting edge of a knife? How could I possibly “change” when every time I think I’ve taken a single step forward, I get knocked back ten feet?

I’m so tired. I don’t want to fight anymore. All I can see in my future is the same pain and misery that’s been filling my life since high school. The only reason I’m alive is because I don’t want to leave my pain with anyone else. Everyone thinks 2020 will be the year of opportunity.... All I see is rain...",1

train_pid_1200,"Coming out about your mental illness : I have been battling debilitating social anxiety and depression for years. The past few months have been extremely rough for me. Only my brother knows about this. I visit a handful of friends and family for holidays each year. This year however, my people are realizing that something is wrong. I have become a lot quieter and I no longer enjoy things i previously did ( I no longer enjoy anything to be honest). I had managed to fake happiness in the past but now I am really struggling. I kept getting questions as to why I am so numb to everything.  I lied saying I had flu the week before and not feeling 100%.
I needed suggestions whether or not I should confess to my family and friends? The reasons i didn't do it till now are :
1)Mental health awareness is very poor in my country. My family would likely think I am faking it or everybody feels low sometimes
2)Afraid of being judged by the very few friends I have left. I am also afraid they might leave me eventually

train_pid_3932,"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life? 

I’ve been depressed most of my life. And for once I don’t want to get better. Because it just doesn’t make sense to be happy if everyone else around me isn’t.",1

She had to have her thyroid removed and will be fine, but it will be something she has to deal with for the rest of her life. She has gotten an outpouring of support from friends and family, just hundreds of people showering her with love. She has been very open with my sister and her other friends about how hard this has been for her, throwing off her life plan and setting her potentially on a difference course.

I feel incredibly bad for her and recognize how horrible and life-changing this is, but I also can’t help but feel a little bit jealous. Jealous that she can be so vocal about her frustrations and her illness and receive nothing but empathy and love from absolutely everyone. 

I (22) developed major depression at about 19 and it completely destroyed me and my life plan. It will be something I have to deal with everyday for my rest of my life, and I will never be the same. But I don’t get to talk about it with people. 

While my sister’s friend is labeled strong for dealing with her cancer, I’m labeled weak for being depressed. People view her cancer as a problem she deals with while instead viewing me as a problem for having depression. Even people who are generally sympathetic and kind still think this way and it shows in small ways. Even my parents who are supportive and loving see my persistent depression as a failure on my part.

train_pid_8512,"Question about coming off meds (cymbalta) : Hey just wanted to know if someone in the same boat could offer some advice. 
Long story short I’m depressed and a little bit anxious and have been on cymbalta the last 3 or 4 years. On 90mg a day for a while then I did a lot of work on myself last year and lost some weight and dropped to 60 and then in November to 30mg (all this was discussed with my psychiatrist btw).
So I saw him maybe 3 weeks ago and we decided to try coming off entirely. So for the first week I was taking one every other day but now haven’t had one for maybe 5 days.

And so that’s the backstory, but my questions are about side effects from coming off them. I just feel really down and emotional at the moment. And I’m really hoping it’s just a temporary thing as I get used to not having meds, and that this isn’t just what I am like off the meds entirely :/ 
Specifically I just feel really sad and down and lack of energy but not like sleepy. It’s more of a sadness then just depressed. And a little bit of anxiety. I suppose it doesn’t help that cause of the holidays I’ve been drinking a bit and eating really unhealthily. 
But anyway I gues the main question is - is it normal to feel this way when coming off antidepressants and is it just temporary? Has anyone else come off cymbalta - what was it like for you?",2

train_pid_4542,New year same depression : What the fuck? I thought 2020 would be my year. The minute I woke up today I had a gut feeling that nothing is going to be better. My energy level is low and I’m so depressed rn. I’m thankful for everything in my life but I feel like I’m only going to go down:(,1

train_pid_4088,"So far down, you feel like you’re weighted at the bottom of a pool : That’s how my depression feels like if I could describe it. Just that I’m drowning in my own misery at times. I’ve been chronically depressed for 10+ years but it has just gotten worse the older I’ve gotten.

I’ve coped by eating. Now I’m not obese but I have put on a good 20-30 pounds. It’s a viscous cycle. I’m depressed, eat my feelings, hate how I look, eat more to make myself feel better. I’m TRYING my hardest to go to the gym and make healthier choices but it’s a constant struggle and takes a lot of energy out of me, especially someone who HATES working out with a passion. I wish I was one of this fitness addicts, but sadly am not.

Worst part is just having enough energy to get up in the morning. I maintain a full time, 40 hour a week job but I’m mentally and physically exhausted 24/7 and caffeine doesn’t do a damn thing to me. Anyone else go to bed early and still wake up exhausted? I take 5-HTP and Valerian Root as my anxiety is through the roof. It helps me sleep most nights, considering I was on Ambien for almost 2 years. 

Have a couple dr. appts this month to get on anti depressants and get back into counseling. Just want to know if anyone out there feels similar to how I do and what do you do/ has helped you cope?",1

Mu best friend ditched me to go to a party with her ex that im not invited to because her ex hates me. Noone besides that friend wished me a happy new year. None of my so called ""friends"" bothered to even text me. All i can think is if i killed myself right here right now how long would it take till someone found me. Days maybe weeks hell maybe they wouldnt notice until my body started to smell. Its not like anyone checks up on me. The only thing stopping me is my best friend would think its her fault. Noone deserves to be the person that couldve been there to save you right. I was that person when my old best friend killed herself. Its a shitty feeling but it wouldnt be wrong if i hadnt been ditched i wouldnt feel so alone and betrayed. Is this what 2020 is gunna be am i just gunna watch everyone walk away from me until im utterly alone.",1

Then, i just hit the rock bottom of my life and its been 2 years since then that i haven't felt myself. I can hardly make any friends and even if i do, they are least interested in me. I don't know what else to. I work 5x harder than i used to before to get out of this mess and still i don't get the desired results. It feels like i just come back to where i was before. This depression is just eating me alive. I felt like quitting it already but my parents are good people, they care and always do but i just don't wanna burden them anymore and i already have let them down so many times. They work very hard and i don't wanna add up to your burden. Therapy doesn't work well for me because all they do is recommend is some pills and then ease the pain but how do i end this pain?

train_pid_2727,"The person I consider my best friend is not reciprocal and that is about to destroy me : I am a genuinely introverted person, so it was extremely difficult for me to make this friend in 2019. It all started at the beginning of last year. We took some classes together, but I never spoke to him then. One day he arrived with a GOT shirt, I asked about it and we started texting since then and I found we shared a lot of things. I proposed him to study with me for the final exams of that semester, he accepted and that was how I got to know him much more (or at least I thought I knew him).

I was very happy to have a friend, after years without success. We kept communicating during vacations and the new semester began. Now we did everything together, lunch, study, we took the same classes. I spent almost all day with him. The only bad part, perhaps, was that while I always offered him my academic help,  he was not trying to do anything for me (not even asking how my day was). I let that happen because my happiness blinded me. One day he started to get away from me and did it progressively until we barely talked during classes and the conversation became very uncomfortable. I talked to him about the way I felt and he told me that he had started dating a girl, that she made him feel really blissful, so he asked me to please understand that. ""I will spend less time with you, maybe we don't have lunch together anymore, won't go to the movies together, but we'll still be friends."" I tried to understand him but I couldn't help feeling jealous, besides I felt now he was uncomfortable being with me. I decided to stop talking to him and I informed him that, which he took very well. At that moment my suicidal tendencies began. I did not understand why, I was happy without having friends before and now I felt so weak and helpless by a person I did not know the previous year. I guess my weak character makes me dependent on anyone who is 'nice' with me. My dog ​​died two weeks after that, she was the only one who had been helping me overcome all  that crap, my true friend from the beginning, someone whom I loved deeply. I tried to kill myself twice, I failed both. My 'friend' knew about my suicidal tendencies but did nothing to help me. However he was happy, why would he bother to understand my stupid problems?

On the last day of the last semester he decided to talk to me, he was a little drunk and asked if we could start from scratch. I agreed stupidly, which I am very sorry for. I agreed because I had no one else, moreover I had the clumsy idea that I could be happy again. Nothing further from reality. It does not answer most of my messages (messages that I write 2 or 3 times a week to not drive him crazy). He has not answered my greeting for the New Year and I still think he will need my help the following semester. I think ending that relationship would only destroy me. I have truly come to feel much steem for him and I still admire his extroversion. I'm already miserable enough, I don't want to ruin it again. What I can do? I have no one else.",1

My mom is pretty much my only other support system and she has her own problems and lately I don’t feel any relief or catharsis from talking to her. She tries to be positive for me, but it doesn’t seem real or anything that I actually want to implement. 

I was going to therapy for a while, and I have an appointment in a week or two, but I hate it. I feel like I never get to the actual root of the problem, and I have a harder time being honest because I feel like I’m expected to be like a level-headed person.

train_pid_8848,"I can feel happiness? : I (22F) have spent the last 8 years of my life with intense depression. I never thought I had real depression though, just a series of bad days (the series lasted YEARS and I still didn't think it was REAL depression???). 
Eventually I tried to end it. It didn't work, so I tried harder 2 weeks later. I landed in the ICU for 3 days and a psych ward for a week. I was pissed. They made me start on meds and go to therapy 8 hours every day. When I got out, I spent the next 3 weeks with my family, so I couldn't try anything because everyone was watching me like a hawk. But over that month of being on meds, I gradually wanted to die less and less. I was still pretty unhappy, but not suicidal. 
I got up the courage, thanks to my husband, to go to a doctor and ask if there was anything else I could do to feel happy instead of just not suicidal. She prescribed two other meds, so now I take 3. They worked.
Now, I'm not just not suicidal, I'm consistently happy. It's something I haven't felt in 8 years. Every time I feel that joy a tear or 3 roll down my cheek because I spent the last 8 years miserable, when $20/mo of prescriptions would have changed that. I'm crying now typing this out. 
Now, when I face challenges, I want to figure out a way to overcome them instead of figuring out the most painless/clean way to die. I can genuinely smile again?? I want to keep the commitments I made to my friends? It's honestly kind of bewildering. 
I'm a little scared of happiness after these years, but it feels so good. The people around me seem more friendly because I'M more friendly. I thought it was just a bad day all this time when it was literally a chemical problem. It wasn't my fault, it wasn't some kind of moral failure. The meds worked, they fixed the chemical problem. 
I don't have a message here, except maybe try meds &amp; therapy if you're hesitant? I'm not trying to be preachy, I'm just overwhelmed.

I’m currently in a recovery/uphill from my depression and anxiety, but I have to leave this subreddit due to the constant negativity from other sufferers. Reading posts relating to self deprication and suicide makes my negative thoughts and memories trickle back. It’s not a good cycle.

train_pid_3460,"I can't escape, I don't think escape from this exists. Maybe none of this is real : I've been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember. It never goes away, I just have some days that I deal with it better than others. I'm not sure I've ever actually been happy in my life.

I feel so disconnected from the rest of the world, especially from other people who have depression or talk about depression or treat depression, because the things they say about it make no sense to me and nothing seems to happen in the same way to me as other people. Medical professionals always ask me if I'm suicidal, and I know that's a thing, but only because people keep telling me so. Otherwise it makes as much sense to me as painting your nose blue for a broken arm. And then I guess since I'm not going to kill myself I'm not that bad off or whatever.

I've been in therapy for about 15 years now, and to say it hasn't helped is an understatement. I can't think of a conversation I've had with a therapist where it felt like they understood what I was saying at all, or that we were even talking about the same thing. I've tried one therapist after another, taken all the medications they gave me. Literally no effect. That's not just my perception. My friends and family agree that none of the treatments seemed to be helping me, and so did my most recent therapist (who I saw for more than two years).

I've tried the bad things, too. The things people do when they're hurting even though it's bad for them, but they don't stop because they just want to feel better. I made a serious, concerted effort to become an alcoholic, but it's really hard for me to get drunk. It costs $50-100 at a bar, and if I'm home alone I literally can't. I can drink until my head aches and I want to puke, but not get drunk. I tried drugs with similar results. (Admittedly nothing too hard - I'm afraid I'd get addicted and still not feel better.) I've tried physically hurting myself, but it only hurts. I've tried whoring around, and even that wasn't enjoyable (got kinda boring). 

I just need to feel better, but I can't figure out how. Literally nothing makes the pain stop. I've started thinking maybe I'm not human. Or maybe I'm stuck in some kind of artificial world, and it's like I'm trying to sate real hunger with virtual food. Of course it doesn't work. I don't know how to get out though.

I feel very alone. And its scares me. I feel like a pansy saying that, seeing that I'm such a big guy with a lot of care. I want to tell them ""Hey I'm not doing very well."" But they're all drunk or high and I can't actually get my thoughts across to them.

train_pid_8693,"I’m a Soft Machine; a Vent and a Wish. : I want to get everything off my chest, I’m not concerned with the length of this as much as I want to just spill it all like a God fearing man in a confessional. The years of depression and anxiety has made me fickle. I’m really not a mean person; just emotionally inept as of late. When the passion you had gets drained, it’s hard to find a reason to care about what you say or even continue. So if I say something that seems rude or extreme, I’m sorry. Although I’m sure most of you can relate to me on this one. To start, I’m 18 I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and Panic Disorder. They are mostly related to one another and just perpetuate when one flares up. I’m so tired, I’m so unhappy, and the moments where I feel happy are fleeting and don’t remain long. I’m struggling more and more to pick myself back up and reclaim my former self. It doesn’t much help that when you get prescribed the Pandora’s box that is SSRI’s, people see you different. Not negatively, just different; a house made of egg shells. Something that could crumble with a glance, and it’s not entirely incorrect. So you hide it, because you don’t want people to care. You hate to be responsible, hate that they’re watching with pressure, hate to be called by your parents because it reminds you of when you were young. Reminds you of what it’s like to be you again; seems so long ago. SSRIs remove the flavor of life, emotions. And no matter how much spice you give, you still can’t taste it. It’s a float, it’s a delay. It’s a way to postpone your flavor until your brain decides to let you have them back. But even prescriptions upon closer inspection reveal a unbecoming truth. The truth that we aren’t as in control as we wish we could be. Our thoughts are a hop, skip and a small oval green pill from being nothing more then a scribble in the sand. But despite the odds, I’m still moving. I’m still here. I won’t let my existentialism bring me down more then it has. I wish for one day where I’m happy again, and I wish the best for all of you!

Like that interval when you're lying in bed, the lights off, and you're *trying* (desperately) to sleep (which is a bit of contradiction in itself) - that's one of my least favourite moments of human experience. For me that's when the really horrible thoughts come from all sides, and time goes agonisingly slowly, and I'm just there tossing and turning, trying and failing to sleep for what feels like eternity, and it sucks big time. I very much dislike that shit. So what I do is - and it's not really a conscious decision, like it's just what happens, or what I let happen - is I stay up. Late. Real late.

On one level to avoid that moment, so that I'll be so exhausted that I just drop, on another, so that I don't have to face the next day with all its inevitable tedium (a delusion).

Anyone else have similar experience? Maybe have some tips? I know I have a surrender problem, I can't let go or be still, and that I should start meditating as a regular practice, and that I need to start being with myself more and communicating with myself more, like starting a journal or something. And get back into regular exercise. And cut down on screen time. But idk, whenever I start doing these things, they quite quickly drop off.

And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me.

train_pid_1716,"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life? 

I’ve been depressed most of my life. And for once I don’t want to get better. Because it just doesn’t make sense to be happy if everyone else around me isn’t.",1

train_pid_2444,"If you don’t want to read this, you don’t have to. I’m just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet. : You know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis? Well I’m basically doing the same thing but posting in on a website in which I don’t know anybody. This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",1

train_pid_3432,"Emotionally deprived : Hey, everyone. Happy new 2020 wish you hope and good things. I'm not sure if this is the place because I don't feel depressed. The issue is that I don't feel the same way as before. I've been binge watching these RadioTTS videos on YT lately which are like compilations of creepy, disgusting etc. stories from reddit and I found out that I'm not creeped out or disgusted by them. I was never easily disgusted so I suppose that's normal. But I've been very easily spooked as a kid and now it's like there has to be something really dangerous to make me freak out. I catch myself sometimes talking with friends and somebody says about something that made him feel a certain way and I just can't relate with them. For example they say something that made them sad and everybody starts to sympathize. I just simulate that I'm sympathetic but I don't really feel it that way. I had a rough childhood. Had to live through a lot of shit and man up early on. So yeah that is basically what I feel like lately and wanted to share and ask if there's something I have to worry about.",1
train_pid_1691,"I dont think I have much time left. : Im hoping this will be a stepping stone before I get inprocessed with a therapist next week. Im trying to type without being too emotional while staying logical.

My godfather passed away recently. I considered him my father. I have no bad memories with him, id call him once or twice a week, see him whenever I could. He was always ill and his own son is a heroin addict and acts as such. We were extremely close, he was the only person I could truly talk to about anything.

When I got the news, I felt like he was the only reason I made it this long and Im spiraling like crazy now. He was the buffer I had from realizing how rough of a life I have had, self induced or otherwise. Backstory to follow.

I grew up living with my mom and visiting my godparents frequently. My dad quit coming around when I was 10 and back when I was 19 after I graduated basic. We moved around every year to different city or state, I didnt really make a lot of friends until late middle school years. My mom married a man who was very controlling, unfaithful and abusive in a non physical manner. I  left for the navy in 2011 do to intel and ultimately ended up doing special operations work. I had also gotten married and divorced, im now remarried to someone who cares for me deeply, but has been unfaithful, and done a lot of other things that I question. 

When I got back from my last tour with a special operations unit and leading up to my godfathers death, I just have never felt right. I had a huge breakdown in Germany while heading home. I have cut ties with toxic people where I see fit. My mother and I had a big falling out after I got back as well over something as dumb as me getting a piercing, yet my tattoos dont bother her. We are still on bad terms despite my apologies.

I have been with 3 counselors for the above issues, including PTSD from my deployments. Im still managing to do alright in school for engineering technology, and I play guitar for a band and write my own music. I left the Navy and im searching for my career path while doing the aforementioned.

I just feel like its all too much, that I have hurt so many people, that I am a burden, and I am cursed to be a toxic and unhappy person. I havent thought about death until the last few weeks but its such a peaceful thought. My last therapist was very helpful with my self deprecating thoughts but she moved across the country.

The pain it would cause my wife is why I do not follow through and why I havent made an attempt.

Thank you for reading my story, and please do not be too alarmed. I think if I can make it back to therapy I may be okay. Just getting it off my chest a little is helpful.",1

train_pid_5469,"Decline, Hope, Jealousy and idc what else : I have been a high functioning depressed person for a long time. Got into special programs, went to class for gifted kids in what is pretty much the best school in my country, and what else. I was born into an upper middle class family. Naturally athletic, pretty charismatic and good at socializing, and not particularly bad looking. Essentially, I was lucky and nothing else. Never had to work for anything. I was a smart and sharp kid, way above average. 

But the public education system doesn't suit everybody, and if it doesn't suit you, you get fucked. Bam, Zero learning skills and super lazy because i never had  to work for shit. Social skills got dunked on because a teacher said something that stuck with for a long time (not their fault, they were absolutely correct)

So here. finished with elementary school, now entering middle school. Gifted class yada yada. It hits me like a truck. I've had minor depression before hand, but here it starts to really show up.  grades start to decline.  Parents who were used to nothing less than 95s punish me and yell at me, and that takes me down even farther. Later on they understand, but it's too late. The years go by and the depression gets worse ever so slightly as i go on. I get into a luxurious govt program. Puts me under a whole lot of stress since, you know, no learning skills and super lazy. I also get diagnosed with ADD around this time so i get some much needed help for that (but sadly the pills only worsen my depression). I keep going, and get into highschool. It's bad. i leave the program halfway through the year, and also move from electrics course to CS. fast forward, and I leave the physics course and i still haven't caught up to my class in CS because as i said, I'm lazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

by now depression is running wild and i am no longer high functioning.  I no longer shower everyday, i eat less and less, my mind is less sharp and my memory isn't what it used to be. The only reason i wake up is because I'm used to it and because i know i'll get yelled at or punished if i so much as say i don't want to go to school. Doing things i enjoy is getting harder, since I either don't have the energy to them or because my parents take them away because I have depression. Life is pain. I can't function, I don't want to function, and I don't want to be able/want to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I had dreams. A future people promised me. Gone. It's not achievable. And it fucking HURTS. Sometimes I gain hopes, but they're shut down so quickly by life.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to bring myself to hurt myself.  Tried. A lot. Could never actually get it done. I get jealous when I see posts about people who did because i know that's the only way my parents will believe i have depression. A therapist already confirmed it to them but that's not enough i guess. I hope I'll hurt them a lot if and when I actually kill myself

train_pid_5347,"One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea. : So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.

But that’s not exactly what I want to talk about here. I’ve been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole “adult” life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I’m 26 now). I’m so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it’s hard to say I’ve ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I’ve made some really great friends, I’ve done some writing which I’m actually halfway proud of, I’ve had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I’m still alive. I’m still here. 

But this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.

I’ve never believed suicide was “the cowards way out,” nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don’t sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.

I’ve also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.

Yes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager’s pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it’s also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can’t hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I’m being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. 

And of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year’s Day. Doubt that’s a coincidence.

In some ways, I felt like a completely different person; I became more empathetic, my grades went up, I had more motivation then maybe ever before, I completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something I started doing as a form of self harm when I was around 8, but I was still me in the sense of personality. For once, I truely felt like myself. That said though, the bad days became so much worse; I wasn't used to it, it wasn't my norm anymore. I'm still so grateful to have been able to experience that, to know what it felt like to function normally. When things first started to get better trough, that was exactly what I was afraid of. That it would be worse when things got bad, and if it got really bad again, I wasn't sure if I even would be able to recover. To an extent, I was right. Now, the period of constant okayness is ending. I'm having less and less good days, and it's awful. I'm having more breakdowns than I did when I was suicidal, and when it happens now, I almost always get really close to passing out, and that never happened before. I just want this to be over and I don't care if that happens because I get better again, of if it's because I get used to it again, I just want this to stop.",2
train_pid_1075,"Just talking and rambling on idk : Hey everyone, I mainly just came to post my thoughts and read whatever anyone says or see if anyone has similar experiences or feels the same. Today was probably one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was really looking forward to hanging out and partying with my friends for new years but idk they didnt want to party they wanted to play playstation which is fine I guess but idk we're in our 20s it's new years eve we always used to party but idk so basically I ended up spending it by myself and on top of that I got some weed thinking that would definetly make it better but got either the worst mid ever or some straight cbd bud idk its trash though I know that for sure, but idk for some reason after today and how it went like it just pushed to the point of that's it like I'm done with these people and I wont talk to them anymore, I'm starting all the way over and I'll try to make new friends or whatever, I deleted all my social media theres literally no way for anyone besides my family which is my grandma mom and 2 brothers to contact me. Ive just had a shitty day, but theres a backstory to it, I've always been not necessarily depressed but I usually feel kind of a mix of down and lonely extremely lonely for sure. Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",1
train_pid_5009,"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent.",1

train_pid_1686,"One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea. : So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.

But that’s not exactly what I want to talk about here. I’ve been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole “adult” life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I’m 26 now). I’m so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it’s hard to say I’ve ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I’ve made some really great friends, I’ve done some writing which I’m actually halfway proud of, I’ve had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I’m still alive. I’m still here. 

But this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.

I’ve never believed suicide was “the cowards way out,” nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don’t sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.

I’ve also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.

Yes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager’s pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it’s also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can’t hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I’m being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. 

And of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year’s Day. Doubt that’s a coincidence. 

Not really asking for specific advice, to be honest just writing this has made me feel a bit better. I’m also going to post this on /r/suicidewatch, though even after just writing this I don’t feel in any imminent danger right now. Thanks for reading",1
train_pid_5475,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",1

train_pid_7745,"I feel my boyfriend drifting but I don't know how to help : Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on this website, but I'm really just looking for advice. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 5 months, the first two months or so were awesome, we were always together or texting or sending each other memes, then most this stopped happening. I figured he might've been going through something and he just needed his space. We're both introverts so I've been there, I also need space from people so I've been giving him his space for a couple months. Today, I went and visited him while he was working (we work together and I had the day off but I occasionally visit him while he's working) and I could tell he looked super tired, and not just from lack of sleep. I could sense that he was down more than I'd ever seen him before, and a lot of the things that I had seen in him I'd also seen in me previously. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago and I've learned to manage it, but a lot of what I was seeing and what he was explaining to me that he was feeling was very similar to how I use to feel before I was diagnosed and I had no idea what was going on. Later that day, I wrote down everything that has helped me, hoping that he might connect with something I had also experienced. He took it pretty well, said thank you, but since then I've noticed small things that kind of scare me. Like he jokes about wanting to die or he want's life to end, but he points out that he would never actually kill himself and that he promises that he's just joking. I'm just worried and I'm not sure what I can do about it, if I can do anything, like suggesting he see a professional? Has anyone else been in this situation before, what have you done if you have been? Thank you in advance :) I really appreciate anyone that's taken the time to read this.",0

They had moved to Canada and has white collar jobs back home but here they felt frustrated and more often than not they would take it out on me. I worked on farms and helped ends meet. I quickly realized I wasn't quite like the other kids, falling for boys and doing the popular thing. I started to become very internalized and depressed. I even tried to kill myself a few times. But I was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed. My parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart. I did most, but in grade 12 I was struggling a lot. I finished school with a great GPA, but I never finished my online class. I just had too much on my plate( my mental health was really bad here) anyways I decided to switch my major and take that class while I did the other intro classes at school. I told my parents, they decide I was horrible and I got yet another beating. I tried to keep it up. I was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so I got a night job and started working and school.during the day. With my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home I was struggling. My grades at school.staryed to drop, I started to get worse and worse. After two semester and realizing I wasnt going to succeeed I decided to quit school, I moved out and spent a month just sleeping. I was so mentally exhausted. I then looked for a job. I found a decent job working in a lab, I started to save as I eventually wanted to return to university. I went back to tutoring, since I was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around, so I approached them. Back in highschool I used to tutor at my parents home. The students asked if I was able to do that again. I approached my parents hesitant, offered to share part of my earning and tutor there. They said sure 50-50. Hey that was more money than I was making now so it would only help me save more. Time goes on, our relationship seems better, they tell me they miss me and I should move home. I am foolish because I believe them as I am moving home a year later. Enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program I want. I am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me. I look for friends more importantly I am looking for love. Highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me, I ignored them. Ofcourse they weren't wrong. But I wasn't the in crowd so I couldn't afford to be gay aswell. So here I am thinking I am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and I meet this woman at the college. She seems really interested we hit it off, she tell me she loves me and I am puddy. I do everything she wants. Things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her. One day she needs financial help and I being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes. She starts seeing exes and new people. She calls me names, she makes me feel gross about myself and I gain a bunch of weight. My doctor says my health is no good. I am hardly sleeping. I am prescribed xanax. I hate it so I just let myself cry for days and not leave my room. I started seeing a counselor at the college. Cut back to taking just one class so I can have health insurance and work for a year and half and save. Get a car. My.parents are fighting everything i do. Constantly calling me names, I am still being beat up. I start going to jiu jitsu. At 24, I get a handle on my head a bit. I have sat down and decide I am.taking a student loan and studying. I study hard and finishing the engineering bridge program. I have meet someonei think I like I am taking it slow.I had applied to school close but not in the same city so I could justify moving. I am 25 So I move to the island near my city and get admission to a good engineering school. I go to visit the person I have been seeing. I like her, I am open with her, she understands my past. She is sick though and getting better. She is living in south africa with her family. I only see her for 2 weeks. I return start university. I work my ass off and focus. I get an internship. I work hard, I struggle, I am sad every day. I am 26,My mother had gone through my bank stuff and found I has bought a vibrator. We fight, yells and tells me how much of disgrace I am. I have a ring I had bought for the woman I had been seeing. She is sick and can't move to canada so I want to marry her. That find sends me backwards. I had to tried to tell me parent a million times how I feel and the fact i gay, she keeps bringing up marriage to men. If she find a purchase so horrible how will she react to me marrying a woman. I tell my girlfriend how I am feeling, she tells me not to worry and do it at my pace and take my time. She tells me she is okay, she will wait as long as it takes. I see her again for 2 weeks, I love her and her family loves me. Seeing them makes me feel like I am so alone. I feel lonely most days but i am very aware now. 

I am sitting here today watching everyone post a recap of their decade showing their accomplishments and here is am.not even halfway through my degree, lonely and scared, uncomfortable in my skin. Unsure of how to come out how to find a balance between the guilt I feel for not being a good daughter or staying in hiding and forever losing the person I love if not today then someday. I am sitting here in tears wondering when things got so messy, when I became so alone, when no one remembers my birthday, no one wishes me for holidays. Where my depression is now crippled with anxiety and I am fatter and unhealthier than I have ever been. 

Okay it is too long I will stop now!",1

The people I was friends with I've grown away from and I no longer feel enjoyment doing what I used to like.

But just existed and waiting for life to pass isnt what I want, I don't know how to break the cycle. I committed myself last year after a rough period but regretted that decision, I've tried talking to therapists but nothing like that has helped. I had a fling that helped but it was back worse when it was over and I havent been able to climb back.

I want to get a tattoo

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do.

I still spent every holiday alone, including my birthday, which affected me a lot more than I'd ever admit outside of reddit.

I’ve moved two years ago to a new country.

I was already feeling like shit the past months: apathy, getting drunk consecutively, feeling no energy, no belonging anywhere and not able to empathize and unable to sleep. Anger and revolt with myself and the ones around me...

I have a great girlfriend, a good job but I feel so bad about myself everyday, I actually started hating my self so much with no good reason.  Just want to be alone...Thought coming back home would help.

Coming back home for the holidays my house is a wreck: my grandmother just started to have Alzheimer’s (my birthday was actually the first day she didn’t recognized me), my father is totally depressed, my mother is also lost and I keep on passing the days alpathic with no action whatsoever, and for some reason I feel angry, revolted and aparhic...just to feel guilt afterwards ...I do t know how to react and I keep on being a jerk or at least feeling like one. I hate myself and I keep on feeling angry by the fact that I cannot properly react or act upon the shedding place my home and my mind has become...

I even thought about killing myself the past days but I think I really cannot...

Being away now for two years also provided me with a feeling of not belonging anywhere (I also left home and my hometown at 18 until 32)...so I really feel I cannot belong, I feel bad, feel ugly, feel sad, feel alone.

Am I becoming depressed and should I find some help? Or should I just try to do something about my atitude?

I struggle with no social network, no friends, no family. The ones I do have occasionally come around don't want to hear me talk, they leave if I start talking about how I feel. They only come over to ask for money.  I have no friends. They've been a big addition to my problems. My best friend of twenty years slept with my girlfriend (the mother of my children) at the time. My other closest friends have went to prison for their bad habits. I've broke my bad habits thinking it would help clear my mental state.

Lately I have been feeling like I don't even have her. I cannot and will not let my kids know the side of me that is troubled. I put on a fake smile every single day.
No one listens to me when I am having an anxiety attack or a depressive state and am crying. The last big attack from anxiety I had I was told that I can't help as much or it's not the same for my wife to talk to me while I'm dealing with my own problems and she feels like she can't. 
Some days I feel like I need something to happen to take me out of action. Other days I debate making it happen myself. I have struggled for years and no one listens. I pay some person for therapy that is only listening because of money, but then tries to tell me how to handle things in ways I've already tried.
My mother is dead, has been since I was a child. My father is a piece of garbage who sells drugs and was abusive growing up. Why am I like this? Why was I placed in the position I'm in? Why was it like this growing up? Why did someone try to molest me when I was a teenager? Why didn't anyone do anything once they saw it or heard it?

My friends and family very rarely celebrate it with me, and when they do, its over during NYE celebrations, or ends up being an extremely mild affair. I see so many people throughout the year get completely spoiled on their birthdays. While I have got used to this disappointment, I was looking forward to this year, as my Boyfriend is a very thoughtful person, so I thought he would pull out all the stops. Turns out he didnt. His birthday was in November, and I took us on holiday for it. However, when I asked him yesterday if he planned anything, he hadn't. So I booked the restaurant. He has kids from a previous marriage, and I then realised that he has the kids that weekend. He said he would rearrange it, which he did, but I'm gutted, and heart broken tbh. I put so much thought into his birthday, yet he couldnt be bothered to organise anything for mine, or even confirming whether he had his kids that weekend or not.

Nobody I know truly understands what I’m going through. This is all I have.  Please let somebody read my book and actually connect with it. Let me not be the only one who has the feelings. I had nothing else. The world could at least give me this. The “new year” could at least give me this. I need this.,1
train_pid_2271,"I don't know why I'm depressed : I have been feeling down for about 3 weeks.. I don't know why or exactly when it started. I'm usually doing alright in the day, meaning I dont feel suicidal or too depressed but in the evenings i feel so lonely and depressed I get suicidal. I am 16 years old and I have always hated drugs and alcohol but I got a friend who said he can sell some weed(which is fairly uncommon where I live) and I drank some alcohol my dad had after my parents went to sleep. I don't feel like burdening anyone with telling them how I feel but i don't know what to do anymore.. I'm really considering buying the weed and just smoking my problems away..",1

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?",2

train_pid_4414,"Happy new year : Never posted in here before, 2019 was quite a year of loneliness. Turned 21 spent my birthday alone all day, 3 failed relationships, One of my best friends found a girlfriend which I couldn’t be happier for he deserves it however, it has led to him disappearing from my life as well as his other friends, Ive also lost a few contracts on jobs. 2018/2019 wasn’t my best years and 2019 was by far the lowest. 

Never been one to be invited to parties as much as I socialize and try to make more friends. but a friend invited me to one last minute tonight. So I showed up but only familiar faces of a class that graduated before me and who had no idea who I was so I looked for my friend and he was on the side of the house throwing up. Grabbed him some waters and a few napkins and left. Spent 40 minutes driving around by my self listening to music.

Here’s to 2020. More lonely nights. More ignored texts. More rejections. More watching everyone’s happy lives on social media. Doubt it will get better for my self. But I hope it changes for the rest of you. Happy new year.",1

train_pid_3682,"If you don’t want to read this, you don’t have to. I’m just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet. : You know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis? Well I’m basically doing the same thing but posting in on a website in which I don’t know anybody. This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",1

train_pid_1231,"My brother passed on Monday morning : Hello, I’m writing this because I don’t know how to cope with this and I don’t know what to do. My brother was a year older than me. We are half brothers. He was fighting with addiction all of 2018. He got clean with the help of our mom and enlisted in the military to try and change his life. He succeeded. He graduated basic and was stationed in Georgia. He was so excited to start traveling the world. He came back last week to our home town to see me, his girlfriend, his son, and our grandma. Well when he was in town he wanted to try it again. He wanted to feel the high as he hasn’t in so long. So he got some Fentanyl pills. He overdosed before Christmas and got rushed to a hospital with his girlfriend. He was saved with Narcan. He told me he took too many OxyContin and thats what caused it. If only I wasn’t so blind. He then overdosed again this last Saturday. I didn’t know about this, but he was revived again. On Sunday he wanted to spend some time with his son, so he stayed at my grandmas house with him. We were supposed to go to the local zoo on Monday.. made plans to spend New Years together before he headed back to Georgia. 

My brother overdosed again on Sunday. We weren’t there to save him this time. Monday morning his son found my brother, his father, slumped and bleeding. My brother was gone. We are planning the funeral now, but it doesn’t feel real to me. I rushed over to my grandmas to see him. I had to see him. Even with that image in my head, I can’t believe it. I don’t know how to process this. I cried when everyone celebrated the new year. This was supposed to be his year. He was just supposed to visit. I don’t know what to do. 

One of my questions is, did he die in piece? Did he feel any pain? I feel like if I knew the answer I could breathe a moment. I want to know what he felt. If he was in pain while going, I know I’ll be a wreck. I know he did not intend to overdose, but it happened and it’s left his family broken. If anyone can help me, please.",1

But recently I’ve really been thinking about it and I’m just so sensitive and I don’t really know how to stop it. I will flip my lid over things I’m not even upset over. I’ll have breakdowns about something and then be perfectly fine after. It just feels like I’m not in control of my emotions but not to the extent of bipolar? It’s been this way since I was a kid and the strongest emotion has always either been anger or soul crushing sadness. 

I’ve tried meditations and all that self help shit but it’s so on the spot idk how to stop it from happening. It really runs my life because I don’t ever leave my comfort zone or its a guaranteed meltdown. I want to live again. I don’t wanna be upset all the fucking time. 

I want to know I’ll come home watch some tv like I knew I wanted instead of dissociating halfway through the first episode and all of a sudden hit a low because I’m by myself. How dare I be by myself, even tho that’s all I want all day. 

This is just word vomit and I’m so sorry I just don’t know where else to put my thoughts.",1
train_pid_2786,"Decline, Hope, Jealousy and idc what else : I have been a high functioning depressed person for a long time. Got into special programs, went to class for gifted kids in what is pretty much the best school in my country, and what else. I was born into an upper middle class family. Naturally athletic, pretty charismatic and good at socializing, and not particularly bad looking. Essentially, I was lucky and nothing else. Never had to work for anything. I was a smart and sharp kid, way above average. 

But the public education system doesn't suit everybody, and if it doesn't suit you, you get fucked. Bam, Zero learning skills and super lazy because i never had  to work for shit. Social skills got dunked on because a teacher said something that stuck with for a long time (not their fault, they were absolutely correct)

So here. finished with elementary school, now entering middle school. Gifted class yada yada. It hits me like a truck. I've had minor depression before hand, but here it starts to really show up.  grades start to decline.  Parents who were used to nothing less than 95s punish me and yell at me, and that takes me down even farther. Later on they understand, but it's too late. The years go by and the depression gets worse ever so slightly as i go on. I get into a luxurious govt program. Puts me under a whole lot of stress since, you know, no learning skills and super lazy. I also get diagnosed with ADD around this time so i get some much needed help for that (but sadly the pills only worsen my depression). I keep going, and get into highschool. It's bad. i leave the program halfway through the year, and also move from electrics course to CS. fast forward, and I leave the physics course and i still haven't caught up to my class in CS because as i said, I'm lazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

by now depression is running wild and i am no longer high functioning.  I no longer shower everyday, i eat less and less, my mind is less sharp and my memory isn't what it used to be. The only reason i wake up is because I'm used to it and because i know i'll get yelled at or punished if i so much as say i don't want to go to school. Doing things i enjoy is getting harder, since I either don't have the energy to them or because my parents take them away because I have depression. Life is pain. I can't function, I don't want to function, and I don't want to be able/want to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I had dreams. A future people promised me. Gone. It's not achievable. And it fucking HURTS. Sometimes I gain hopes, but they're shut down so quickly by life.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to bring myself to hurt myself.  Tried. A lot. Could never actually get it done. I get jealous when I see posts about people who did because i know that's the only way my parents will believe i have depression. A therapist already confirmed it to them but that's not enough i guess. I hope I'll hurt them a lot if and when I actually kill myself

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want any ""it gets better"" or bullcrap like that.

We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were.

I just want to pursue the goals I had, do the things I used to love, and live by the meaning and purpose that used to reside inside. But then a combination of mental illness, past trauma, dysfunction, and bad choices on my part, as well as on the parts of others led me down this path. In my heart, I still want what I wanted. The path I was on. But I have no idea how I can ever get there. I have no idea what to do. There are even people that influenced my life that I have dreamed of contacting, but I feel like it wouldn't matter.

The main thing I want/wanted to achieve in this life was to make my parents proud but I hate studies and apparently that's the only way to keep them happy. Both my parents have said that I am a failure and my mom just straight up said to my grandmother that ""It's a disgrace I was born in this family. "" And they said all this because I got above average or actually pretty good marks in some very important exam. I actually worked quite hard for it and after the exams were over I took a break of 2 months from the studies. Maybe they said all that bad stuff cause they were angry but it's too late now. The thing that hurts me the most is that neither of them have still said ""You did good. "" Infact other family relatives have said that. Because of this thing happening to me I lost all my ambition of doing something and now don't study anything and there are chances I might fail. Because they just want me to study I don't go out with my friends that much. Rarely like once in 2 months. Because of this I don't have any very very good friends.

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

He would always tell me to just take it day by day and that we'd figure it out together. He'd tell me to lean on him when I need to, to talk to him or yell and rant and rave at him if it would make me feel better and he'd ride it out with me. Well, I took him up on that offer for once, choosing to open up rather than bottle it up and ""deal with it"" myself like I usually do. Now, all we've done is fight these past couple weeks, and I'm so fed up with it.

I told him I didn't want to open up in this way because I knew he was going to take everything personally and end up making me feel even worse.

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. 

My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don’t want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn’t functioning.

train_pid_4570,"unrequited love is detrimental to my mental health. tips to cutting out a toxic person. : hi reddit, this is embarrassing, but let me share. for reference i'm 22 and he's 24. we live in the same city.

so, i met this guy over a year ago now. we hit it off great and he made me so fucking happy it's unreal. i'd never been so physically attracted to a guy i was with while also finding him hilarious and interesting. i felt myself growing unreasonably attached early, but to my credit he was calling me ""babe"" a week in and telling me how amazing and beautiful i was every day. i'd just gotten out of a 4 year emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship shortly before meeting him, so that might also be a factor as to why i got so attached.

then about a month in he said he didn't want a girlfriend or anything close to that. i was obviously unreasonably devastated, but i figured if that were the case then we would just never talk again and eventually i'd get over it and move on. however, he continued to reach out to me and text me and it turned into him wanting nudes. i reached out just as much after he initiated this. i wanted to please him and make him happy. i didn't want him to stop talking to me. so, i sent him nudes whenever he asked. even if that meant i had to go to the bathroom while in class to send him something because i didn't want to upset him. inbetween this we talked every day about anything and everything. this only made me grow more attached and more desperate even though we were no longer physically meeting up or even hanging out. this hurt a lot, but his reasoning was that he didn't want to use me for sex... even though i guess nudes were fine? i know he didn't have a gf or anything like that it would've still been obvious i was in the picture even for what i was because we talked so frequently and i had him on every social media. 

i decided that if he wasn't going to give me what i wanted fuck it i'll get with other guys. so, i started hooking up with other guys. he was aware, but not happy about it. didn't like to hear about it. we still talked every single day. to my knowledge, he'd only been with 2 other girls during this shit show year of knowing him. both of which i think he tried to form relationships with but one thing or another fell apart. nothing serious. he didn't like to discuss that kind of stuff with me. we still talked every day with the pictures being sent between both of us. i tried to move on as well, but it was hard because i just wanted him. it felt like i was just distracting myself from him. mine were also nothing serious.

for about 2 months i decided to cut him off. i blew up on him and called him toxic and shitty and manipulative. i still thought about him a lot and missed him. i didn't reach out, neither did he. i tried to form a relationship with someone else and i think he did too. either way, we're still both single now. about 4 months ago i reached out again. this time he said he appreciated me for always sticking around, how i was one of his closest friends he'd had, how he wanted to try again with me. this again lasted a month. now i'm right back where i was a year ago.

i just want him to want me so bad, but it's becoming apparent that he is never going to. i think he genuinely does care for me to an extent, but i know i'm in love with him. which is pathetic i know, but i can't help how i feel. he has massively affected my mental health and he is also the only person who can make me feel better which is frustrating. to my credit i'm better than i was a year ago. it used to be all consuming, but now it's something i've pushed to the back of my mind until it gets brought back up again when he's mean to me or when i realize i'm in love with someone who hasn't felt like or made time to see me in person since september.

train_pid_5652,"No one cares : It's been so long since I had a proper conversation with anyone in my life. Just small talk here and there. I used to have a best friend but even he left me during middle school. Sometimes, I really wish I had someone I could wholeheartedly trust and talk to. 
It's not like I wanted to be ALONE intentionally. I tried all I could to make friends. I wasted a couple of years trying to be nice to my fellow classmates when I was in school. I was always there to help them be it with money and effort. I thought they cared. I thought that for a very long time but everything was a lie. They always neglected me. Whenever our class teacher gave us any group assignment, they would always exclude me but be nice to me from outside. They were using me and I was letting them do it. It really disappoints me even to this day.
Most of those so called classmates even bullied me so badly during school days that I still cry to this day. They humiliated me. I was even physically beaten by few of them. None of the teachers that I complained to believed my story and took action against them. It has really MESSED UP my brain to be honest. This feeling is really weighing down on me pretty heavily these days. 
Over the years, I've developed depression and anxiety. I stopped being social because no one cared. My social skills are so degraded now that I'm not able to speak properly to anyone irl. I stumble, hesitate etc. My mind often goes blank or I say the wrong thing unintentionally. I've become a zombie.
There is no one that I can talk to right now. My parents don't understand me and I personally don't want to be a burden to them any longer. I'm already unemployed and eating off their savings while sitting comfortably at home. I keep myself closed inside a room for most part of the day doing random stuff on the internet to seek pleasure. Even when I sometimes try to socialize with people, I find myself not having that good old vibe anymore. It's like I want to avoid every social situation. My condition is pretty bad and is worsening day by day according to me. I try to change but quickly backslide too.

Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at.

train_pid_2776,"Snapped out of depression : So about a month into college I got really high once and completely zoned out for what felt like hours. I was watching a movie with friends but my mind was in a whole different place, I was thinking about why we exist, our origin and I hate to admit, I thought of my parents and felt no love for them whatsoever which really scared me. For about 2 weeks my mind felt like it was clouded, I wanted to see if I was depressed by searching up depression quotes and for some reason every single word hit me. I started going to school in sweat pants and hoodies, didint want to Snapchat or talk to anyone and overall felt disconnected and thought something was wrong with the way my brain thinks. Then one day I woke up and felt completely normal like nothing happened and have been fine ever since 

I’m not sure if that was depression or depersonalization but I never wanted to talk to anyone about it

train_pid_8888,"A Comprehensive Guide To Slowly Getting Better, And Not Losing Hope. : In no way am I an expert, and in no way have I mastered these points, but I have had depression for about 4 years now, and I have seen what works and what doesn’t, and I wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. Depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but I believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub. 
I write this because it makes me feel better, and because I like to help other people. It makes me less depressed. If someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, I will be happy and grateful for it. Being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves. 
In no way are these ordered from most important to least. 
In no way am I suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self-hatred. I do not see hope for myself, but I believe in it regardless. I hope you can too. 
**Exercise Daily -** 
Do something you like. It doesn’t have to be the most intense, fat-burning, crazy workout. All I’m saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. Go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. Try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. Try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. It can be anything from karate to chess (trust me, this actually burns a significant amount of calories!), from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a Shaolin Monk 
**Eat Healthy -** 
We always hear this one, and for good reason! It’s simple, but it gets hard, doesn’t it? We want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. I’m not saying pizza is off the table forever, but I’m saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. Try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! Contrary to popular belief, healthy food CAN taste good. 
**Take Vitamins -**
Many depressed people have low levels of Vitamin D (like me) so I take those regularly alongside some Magnesium supplements. I believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way. 
**Take Meds If You Need Them -** 
Talk to someone. If they suggest pills, try them out. I have had pills that swung me the right way (Lexapro), and I have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way (some green looking pill, I don’t remember what it was but I hated it dude). Everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. Just… try it. I know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. Not a cure, but a step. 
**Journal -** 
This is a big one for me. I have kept up journaling ever since I was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. Writing things down (like this) has a way of soothing the soul, I think. Write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. Write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. Write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy; hopefully at some point. 
**Clean Your Room -** 
I suck at this, but there’s something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. Put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. Get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. You’ll feel better, trust me. 
**Read -** 
This is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but I do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. No, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. Read Matilda for all I care! I read that book in one toilet session and I felt GREAT the rest of the day. 
**Go Outside Once a Day -** 
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something.   
**General Hygiene -** 
Big one. This is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. You’ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. Take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de-odor yourself, whatever! You’ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better. 
**Sleep Well -** 
I’m talking 8 hours at night and not throughout the day. Don’t waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. Do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. You will feel better. You won’t be cured, but you’ll feel better. Your body needs this, friend. 
**Wake Up Early -** 
Again, this might not be for everyone (as a matter of fact, who IS it for really), but trust me when I say that almost EVERY TIME I wake up early and do some stuff I like, the rest of the day feels better because I did something productive at the start of it. I get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it’s great! 
**Be Wise With Money -** 
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect a lot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. 
**Compliment People, Spread Positivity, Without Expecting Anything in Return -** 
This is a great one. Even if you don’t believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. Everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. Here’s the catch: don’t do it for your own gain. Do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. You want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise. 
**Don’t Stay in Your House or Room for Too Long (Poor timing on this one, I know. But go for a walk or something) -** 
This comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. My worst days are when I’m just scrolling Reddit or Pornhub or Facebook and when I’m just… wasting myself away. Get out of your room, be productive, do something. 
**Serve Other People in Some Way -** 
This is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. Help others. Join a non-profit organization and help out once a week. You meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. There’s nothing like it! You are DOING something amazing, even if it is small. You are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. Do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. This could REALLY change your life, as it has mine. 
**Get Together With Friends -** 
Get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. Whether it's at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, ANYTHING. Just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. This may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago (and all of high school too), but try it out. The right people will come, I’m sure of it. 
**Call Family -** 
Whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. It has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, disconnection, abuse; anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. But sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other. 
**Listen to Music -** 
Duh! We all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. For me it’s Coldplay and a little known artist named Chris Renzema. They have been with me through ups and downs (lots of downs). I also listen to William Augusto Instrumentals as I fall asleep each night. Very helpful. 
**Try Out Therapy for a Couple Months -** 
It can be scary, I know. And for me personally therapy didn’t even fully work out for me. But this doesn’t mean I didn’t try it. I tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because I didn’t feel any differently. This won’t be the same for everyone. At least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend. 
**Limit Screen Time if you Can Help it -** 
Less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the TV. All great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? Find a schedule that works for you. I personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to 5 hours a day, and eventually to 2 hours. Small goals, one step at a time. 
**Make Daily To-Do Lists -** 
Most days, in the morning or the day before, I create a to-do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. I even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what I accomplished and so I can put a little checkmark besides it! 
**Take Care of a Pet -** 
I recently got a Bearded Dragon (his name is Henry), and it has given me something new to live for and protect. As someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. Many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. Send me pictures of them so I can tell you how cute they are. 
**Be In Nature -** 
I believe this is for everyone. Get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. Try to travel to a National Park at some point, and take in the sights. Go for a short hike and look at the trees. We are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it. 
**NoFap, NoPorn -** 
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect alot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. 
**Practice Gratitude -** 
Stay thankful for the things that you have. Whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. Just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. Again, I do this too, so let’s get better together. 
*Now, I am a devout Protestant Christian, and I wanted to include my Christian side to this equation. This is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason I am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step.* 
**Pray (For Others and Yourself) -** 
Thank the Lord for the people around you. Voice your anger towards Him. Talk to Him throughout the day, Ask Him to reveal Himself to you and to show you how much He truly loves you. He will do it, for a good Father wants His sons and daughters to be comforted in the midst of a crooked and twisted place that we live.
**Read The Bible -** 
This is the thing upon which we compare everything else. This is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the Lord speaks to His people through His Word. Learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the One who Loves us. 
**Meditate -** 
Christians meditate too! Take time in silence and align yourself with the Holy Spirit, as He speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth. 
**Get Together with Church Community -** 
Get together with others. Ask your questions. Break bread. Share stories. Encourage one another. Learn from the lesson preached by the pastor. Learn. Listen. Grow. Love.
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something. 
Take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in Jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the One who gave it all for them. 
***Hope, my friends. Hope. Take steps to better yourself. Give yourself grace. Keep trying. Hope, my friends. Hope.***",2

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

I always get a massive urge to disappear off the face of the planet for a few days and go camping alone everytime I’m sad but I can’t do that at this time of year. 

 Being 2 hours away from my girlfriend and only being able to see her for 6 hours a week is weighing on me too. I know I should be grateful I have a girlfriend but it’s so exhausting having to talk to her all the time with little physical interaction.

I just don’t feel like myself.",1

I thought I already had what made my life better. But it is gone. So I'm taking a decision too now, not to make my life better I do not want this anymore. Reddit, i wish i was not that lonely, I wish I had been less mean. Maybe I deserve all this, but I won't bear the weight of my world.

This is the first new year I spent completely alone because I am home sick. I could have gone to a friend who was partying with a lot of strangers(to me), but without alcohol I can't even tolerate that for 30 minutes.
So I am sitting at home, alone and I just feel empty again, like so often. It's like this physical black hole in my chest that sucks in all my energy. I have this very often, especially when I am not distracted by anything. 
In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

train_pid_1477,"Fuck this. : I’m using Siri to write this because I just don’t have the energy to write it myself. Everyone hates this holiday I’m not unique in thinking that. And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me. Just so you’re aware I have a history with severe depression and anxiety, this isn’t out of nowhere, although it is my first time posting about it so there is probably a lot of missing nuance and backstory. I’ll probably believe this at some point, but right now I truly just hate myself and everyone around me. Truly the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last few months has been my semi new puppy. I really think that if I had assurances that she would have a happy life without me, I do it tomorrow.",1

I already feel like an inconvenience and killing myself would only prove that. Why is it that the people who come back from their depression and do meaningful things with their lives are seen as the heroes. What about the people who never find their way out. Maybe they're just being true to themselves by committing suicide, maybe it's okay for them to leave, because that's what they truly desire and they have been living in hell on earth. And maybe it takes bravery to end their life with all the pressure from everyone else to just keep going. I'm sick of just staying here for everyone else, can I just do something for me once? Something that I actually want? If people truly loved me wouldn't they want my suffering to end, whatever the cost, even if it inconvenienced them? I dunno. I just don't fucking care anymore.

train_pid_4857,"Just a couple of feelings. And, ""hello, friends!"" : It's January 1st, 2020. I have never published anything in Reddit before, but I found some posts here that encouraged me to write a little on my feelings.

I have just graduated from high school in November (I am not American nor living in Europe). Now I am about going to start my university studies. I am quite young, most of my colleagues were older than me, and I am younger than the average first-year student in almost countries. I always felt somewhat misplaced and disinterested in what young people do.

I didn't attend my class's prom party. At first, I was thinking financially, as it is not rational to expend a truckload of money in a stupid and small event. My mother got really upset with my decision, but I didn't dare to explicitly say that I was worried about getting us into debt. After some months, my motivations to not attending it was not having established friendships with most of my classmates; I had a few moments of unpleasantness with some of them, but I have no contempt for almost anyone. It was an elite school, with only eight people in the class, most of them extremely affluent.

As well, utter all compliments I hear is about how smart I am, and I have a gracious complexion. I fell as having no true friends - since I was little I got to be surrounded by adults. Today, I was invited by a friend to some museums with her, but I do not feel as sharing secrets as I never could open myself on the pains — physical and psychic ones — to someone. Every day, I fear ending up alone, as I am too avoidant or critical, applying the latter both to myself and to the significant one, and I do not have hope on a great career or in a profitable marriage (I live in the western world, but marriage for convenience is appealing.)

My father quit his job and now tries to succeed in life as a businessman, but the economic scenario in our country has never been good. This past year, my mother, who worked from home for a few years, went into a stable job, but it does not pay too well. Through the year, I tried to make some money — I intended to start investing and also to create an emergency fund, but I always dreamt about moving abroad — considering I am going to study Mathematics and Astronomy; I live in a hostile place to be a scientist, and there were a lot of relatives of mine setting up our documents to live in Europe. I started to spend a lot of money using credit cards, but it was necessary, and then I have to start my savings all over again, after paying what I owe the bank.

My dream university changed its calendar to entrance examinations in a way that I could not be admitted. I am going to matriculate myself in one of the most prestigious university in my country, as it has no tuitions and a demanding pace of studies, and studying abroad is no longer affordable. I have thought a lot on not studying Astronomy — or something as Fine Arts or Philosophy, my other passions — in favour of something that has chances of getting rich, as Medicine.

I cannot take anymore what made me feel so out of place these past few years — I don't have a boyfriend, I don't go to those promiscuous, opulent parties, and I don't travel around the world during the summer holidays. I can no longer delay my visits to doctors for not having the courage to tell someone what I feel, that my allergies weaken me more than ever, that my eyes burn like hell and every inch of my body hurts, and the fear of going to a psychiatrist. I tried therapy a few years ago, and the therapist was able to make me feel worse, as the school educational coordinator.

I am always afraid of not being sufficiently grateful for what I have on Earth, that I have a great background. Poetry can make my breath somewhat lighter, but, consonant to my vision issues and to the stress I was subjected to, I was reading fewer books. I started to believe that I can only hold my life with missions to accomplish, and creating art, fortunately, was a solace in the plethora of trouble I got into, maybe for my future good.",1

It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.",1

train_pid_607,"2020 is the year I take a stand against depression. : Depression is a greedy soab. It takes far too much time, far too many lives. It ruins relationships with families, spouses, friends... It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. 

I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. 

""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   
""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   
""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.

But you know what, depression? Fuck you. I may not be motivated to do anything at all right now but out of sheer spite, as a complete middle finger to this horrible mental affliction... I'm going to prove you wrong. You do not own me.",1

My P.T.S.D is slightly centered around bad incidents, yes, but they are from so far back in this life now and I am thick skinned and tough, and I can take it, but where this ""P.T.S.D."" is really getting to me hard is in moments of happiness not cherished, not even realized. Precious moments lost and opportunities discarded are eating away at my soul like you would not believe. Music, imagery, sounds, smells, so many visuals, feels, everything is taking me back to this past year...

I... I'm going to start fuckin' crying like a baby because this is the first time I've actually come out and said this blatantly without being vague on here with my posts...

You know that feel after a breakup when you know that you're unstable and you cling on and hang on to an image, an attachment of someone? And yet...deep down, you know but don't want to admit to yourself just yet that you do know that they aren't the one? You know how your mind is secretly racing over the ""grass is greener"" thoughts of a new love that will come along? Maybe you're right back on Craigslist or here, or wherever, to just find that immediate relief, someone to talk to...and it all hurts... The time getting through a loss like that hurts, but you do it..?

...When they say ""You'll know,"" they really mean it...

I knew in 2015 that, while I started dating a girl I truly loved and thought was great, I left behind my Soulmate... ...It was a girl whom I met right at the very moment I stopped believing in such things. I ran from her because I thought I saw red flags--my own red flags--where I was about to fall back into an instability of mine to believe in such things...

She just stood out...

...

Long story short: I left her behind... I broke her heard. I thought about her for the next four years and killed my relationship/friendship with the other girl I loved... We broke up just over a year ago, and I waited to let myself calm slightly before going back to find that girl I left behind...

I was numb from a lot of past trauma to have cut my emotions off to begin with regarding love and especially true-love, but in the last four years, I experienced even more trauma...a lot of it... I won't list it here, but it was trauma of many different types.

I started dating my Soulmate at the beginning of 2019, and I took her for granted...

I was so lost that I didn't recognize anything in my life as being ephemeral or breakable or anything... I just.. I was dead inside. I couldn't lift a finger to do anything... I thought I was stable, and that's why I came back into her life, and as soon as I saw her face, just as in 2015, I fell apart... When she is around, the air is electric. It's on fire. I can't explain it. All I know is that she is the catalyst... ..She told me she loved me far before I did in 2015. She used the term Soulmate first. I was terrified. I knew how I reacted to losing loves far less than her...and I didn't want to imagine the possibility of losing her...

I lost her...

Not forever, I dearly hope. This isn't the normal ""break"" relationships take when they truly intend to breakup. ..This is...powerful.. She's sometimes on the other side of the world when it comes to us communicating through our anxieties, but it's never been a problem for us because when it comes to this electric love, we are on the same page, always... We are tethered... I've never heard anyone speak so strongly before about what we share. I'm not worried about it--the love itself--for that is something that can't be broken. What I'm worried about is myself... I'm worried about her... I'm worried about an uncertain future. ..We both struggle with depression more than you could believe.. We have a pact to keep each other in this world. I can't keep writing this.

I don't know where I was going with this.

I don't know.

I can't do therapists. I can't talk to some empty, emotionless human who does it for a job. I just can't. Everyone here is faceless, behind a screen, and for someone as antisocial and distrusting as me, that is the most beautiful kind of human connection. To just see kind words here...

I'm in a bad place, people... I'm really in a bad place... I miss her. I am not like this often. I have an unhealthy pride that does not allow me to show myself like this, and yet here I am. I'll even admit that I've just started crying, and I am trying so hard to force these tears back inside.

...When you meet that person, you just know...

And it isn't rainbows and butterflies, people... Don't envy this... If you have anxiety and depression, don't envy this... It is so fucking terrifying to find the one you love and know that the both of you are not immortal but in fact very, very mortal... You begin to realize how fragile life is and how fleeting it is... I threw away four years that I could have kept my ex as my best friend and spent more time with the girl who makes my world whole. My soul is torn in pieces and deposited in different places, different times throughout these past 5 years... Part of me is dead and still back there in 2015 during that horrible, fateful moment that I left her... I see a certain color in the night air and I crumble because it takes me back to that moment. I watch a music video for a song I love, and I see a plane fly through the sky and it takes me back to last year when she had her head against my shoulder as we flew to San Francisco for her work. I'm just so fucking broken...

Inside I know... I KNOW that I will be with her again, but this has been so much time ... so much time has been wasted ...

...We lost our child...

I have to go.

I can't keep doing this. I can't keep writing.

I don't do this. My pride is killing me, and I need to abandon it, but I can't be weak. I'm going to feel weak. I've had bad things happen to me when I let my shield down. I had my father when I met this girl, and he's dead now. My mother is a piece of shit. I'm sorry, but don't you dare tell me to respect her. She had police point guns at me soon after his death and she watched as they did it. She even smiled. She's barely human. She goes back and forth, and she is one of the most bipolar people I know, yet I am nothing but kind to her, and I live in much closer proximity with her now than I had ever wished to at the age of 30.

Kind words... My pride is fucking killing me right now for asking this, but I just need kind words... I'm not okay... I'm not well...

I will not kill myself. I can't Not as long as she is here and alive...

I'm no longer crying...

I've written like this before, and I've deleted it all... I'm not going to this time...

I'm not comfortable with this, but maybe this is a good thing. Maybe this is a big step for me to take...

...I'm blocking things out... Things I've just written about, I'm blocking them out as I write this last line, and I have to. I've never been able to block things out before. Reality has always been right in my face. But it's getting so rough, that I'm beginning to block shit out.

Everyone here who supports one another and loves blindly and unconditionally through this ""faceless and emotionless"" screen... I love you... I have seen people bring one another up here in ways that make me almost have hope in humanity again...

And yet right around the corner, in some of these subs, people are so horrible to one another...

When will we fucking learn... ..I digress.. I have enough problems of my own without getting into deep, philosophical talks...

I am so uncomfortable with this. But, I'm going to post this.

What a rambling mess of a post... I'll leave this up for a while, but eventually, it's going to get deleted. Or perhaps, I'll just start using a different account. Who knows.

Please don't suggest medication. I was on that stuff for 7-8 or 9 years. I can't remember. All I know is that it really fucked me up.

I don't want a therapist. I just want to post here about random things, and not this, but I am today.

train_pid_8592,"Complete dissatisfied human being. : So I‘m a bit excited about doing a post about it. I‘m struggling from severe depression since I‘m 11. I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.
Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 
Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again. 
Does someone experienced the same? What did you do to get out of it?",2

train_pid_7759,"Stress and feeling like a failure. : Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to keep it as brief as possible
I'm a 22 (almost 23) year old trans women engaged with my girlfriend of three years, and together we have a one year old son. I love them both more than anything. 
However with an active life of work, fiance, and taking care of a child, I feel incredible amounts of stress. It always seems like on my days off there's just one more thing to take care of, or an errand that requires my time. I usually don't have that much free time as I'm constantly busy with keeping my family afloat. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they mean the world to me, but holding it all together is taking its toll on me. 
On top of that I have depressive and gender dysphoric episodes. I feel that my depression stems from ""not being good at anything."" I want to be good at... something. At this point, I'll take anything. My two major hobbies are competitive Super Smash Bros Melee, and I get sad about constantly losing, but I also don't internalize that sadness as much because I don't take it super seriously and its more for fun than anything (though watching your rank on the constant decline on the community leader board can really be a bummer at times). My other major Hobby that I am more concerned about is drawing. I've been taking art classes since I was in 7th grade and I was even in AP art. I constantly have a feeling that I'm never improving. 2010-2015 I used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when I was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, I've hardly done anything. I've made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then I'm not that confident about them. When ever I try to draw today, I just get like, almost physically I'll. I feel like my stomach drops and my heart rate goes up. At work, I have a lot of free time and I try to practice on yellow stickie notes at work but most of the time I usually crumple them up and toss them because I end up not being satisfied. I know that's kinda considered a no no in the art community, but I've been doing this ever since I got a three out of five on my final AP Art portfolio. I tore up a myriad of my AP art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before I even transitioned to female. I want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn't have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. But everytime I get to work I just get really really fucking sad and I feel like I'm not ever going to improve because I've been at this for 10 years now. What's particularly upsetting to me is that I have ADHD, so focus is already a big issue. I want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when I see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile I struggle to even get one started and even when I do get started on one, I fill in like two or three pages and then don't pick one up again for months. Digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it's hard to sit down and actually learn. I can't make it through 5 minutes through an art tutorial of any sort because I just..
 I dunno... get antsy and go watch a Melee clip or a video essay. I don't know how I can easily sit through an hour long video essay about Marxism or whatever, but the moment it comes to the things I really care about, I just can't force myself to pay attention and absorb the learning material. 
I have a long shot dream of making a Sci-Fi cartoon one day. I don't know how to even come close to it considering I can't pay for college, let alone negotiate (argue) medical Bill's with my insurance company in relation to my transition, being barely able to afford the means to keep my family stable, not having enough time to practice, and even if I find time to practice, I just don't out of anxiety or contempt of self. 
It depresses me that I can rationally argue that my dream won't come true and that I'm just going to work a bullshit job for the rest of my life because I just can't get it together. I have days of crying spells where I sit in the shower and have crying fits over gender Dysphoria, depression, and just feeling like a massive failure. 
TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD, Gender Dysphoria, and a busy schedule. I feel those things are getting in the way of me improving at hobbies I want to otherwise improve at, and I feel like a failure for not being able to meet goals",0

I'm trying to cope with everything, but it's really starting to get to me. I've broken down crying nearly every day since the start of the holidays. Maybe I've been too ungrateful, I know my friends(current roommates) have done so much for me... but I've communicated over and over and over about my mental illnesses and what I'm working and what my needs are. That doesn't matter to them I feel like, nothing changes.. they've helped me financially with things like replacing my bed with a smaller one to fit my room, and not starving to death, and even did some laundry for me because of my financial situation... but i told them I couldn't cope with the amount of messes they leave everywhere, and if I so much as leave a small one then I'm in the wrong.. I just wanted to get my education completed and get better with my mental illnesses but everything keeps going wrong and now they're feeling like I'm using them so they're refusing to help me with food, and going so far as to ask me for money when they offer me things like a glass of wine. It's emotionally killing me inside. I'm not against helping in the house but... they make it so unbearable. They're so excruciatingly lazy and they expected me to clean up after them. ""You're not doing anything right now so you can clean it"" was their reasoning...  


I don't know if I'm being selfish and disrespectful.. I'm not trying to be, I just can't handle this much.

train_pid_8834,"My entire life is falling apart due to the coronavirus. : I have diagnosed depression and am on the autism spectrum. As a result the little social interaction I do have is incredibly important and bordering on life saving to me: conferences, board game nights, public events, the few parties I am invited to. When they are present, I’m not happy exactly, but happier. When they are gone, I don’t see much of a point in living.
However, of course, much of that has either been canceled, or is the kind of thing people are saying don’t do for public health reasons, and this seems likely to go on for months, if not longer. (I’m in one of the cities with a lot of cases, and the governor has banned large gatherings already.) So now I have nothing and no one.
The thought of being forced to not leave the house is devastating. The thought of those social events not returning is even more devastating, let alone the long term repercussions to my future career (layoffs have started; conferences are the reasons it exists.) The thought of what happens if I do get sick is devastating both for the normal reasons and because I am never lonelier than when I am sick by myself, with no one to check on me or invested in my life. And I honestly don’t think it is catastrophizing. If anything events are worse than I anticipated.
Basically, it feels like I have been consigned to a joyless life for an indefinite period of time, with serious moral consequences if I go against it, and I don’t know what to do. (I do not have a plan or anything, but I have more than once had the morbid thought that I can’t commit suicide because a dead body is a public health risk.)

When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.

I just realized this a month or so ago, and I haven’t felt safe in any relationship ever since. I question if my relationships are false, or if they just keep me for attention. I’m just ugly, miserable, definitely not a positive influence in any way, and have the most awkward, disgusting personality ever. I’m completely inexperienced with girls, guys, and everyone. (I’m a 15m) There is no reason to be my friend, or be interested in me romantically. I’m f***ing ugly, completely unattractive, and I have a terrible personality. Therefore... I’ve been trying to improve. Working on social interaction, on self-confidence—well, the mask of it—and even been working out pretty intensively to try to get myself to be just ugly... not f***ing ugly. But...

IVE been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half.

She saved me from an abusive relationship. And she Was the best thing in my life. But she was a very broken and unstable person.

She.. Lied. About being raped.  She made fake accounts to harass herself. She made fake accounts to accuse me and herself of cheating on eachother. She has anger issues. And an abusive family.

I helped her as much as i could. And she did too. I saved her from her abusive family and helped make her life better.

Weve been having relationship problems because after she confessed to her lies. She became increasingly abusive and harsh.  And.. A few days ago she cheated. On me.  It was on the same day that she insulted me and called me worthless and stuff

I dont know what to do.. I really dont. I fucking love her so much. I love her more than any thing and.. I forgave everything. My past girlfriend cheated on me 3 times and boasted about it and rubbed it in my face. I let my current know this. I let her know that any thing is okay. But cheating is the one thing i can not deal with. And now when it happened ive been so.. Broken.

I dont think she hates me. She has anger issues. She suffers from bullying. Abusive parenting. And lots of sexual assault.
Shes fucked up. Shes the most innocent. Pure person. But also the most sexual and slutty person. I dont know what to do.. Ive been crying so Much and i have no one to talk to. My best friend thats been the only person supporting kind of.. Got tired of me and told me to fuck off. I feel so suicidal and broken. I cant really talk to anyone in reallife due to my country.

I havent mentioned many things. So please dont make an opinion of me or her before asking me things. If youre willing to help me send me a message and  ill respond as fast as i can

Also somethjng important to mention is that we have really. Really good synergy. Physically we  are perfect for eachother. Sexually too. And our humor. Music taste. Beliefs. Religion. Everything is ideal.",1

train_pid_152,"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",1

And that's kind of where I feel myself going right now. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed but also overwhelmed, and I'm starting to feel the joy flicker out. My last day off from both jobs was Feb. 20th &amp; my next day off isn't until March 19th, and even though I only have a week left until I get there, it's one day and then I'm back to at least 1-2 weeks with no day off. I'm feeling burned out from work, and between never having a lot of time or every, and my insecurities I've been struggling to eat. I've struggled with an eating disorder for a long time on my own and sometimes when I get depressed I forget to eat and then when I do get hungry I feel guilty. Stupid, I know, but it is what it is. Okay so now that you have some backstory/context of what I'm feeling, here's my current problem; 
I've sparked up a friendship with this guy recently (met through reddit, he's British &amp; I'm American) and as silly as it sounds I just connected with him so well. We've been talking every day for a few weeks and we send each other snapchats &amp; voice memos all the time. We've both already admitted to having a crush on each other but we're still just friends &amp; we do a lot of encouraging each other as he seems to deal with similar emotions &amp; doesn't get a lot of sleep. We both always dread work and feel exhausted by our day but today for me was just draining on such an intense level that didn't really hit me until I got home. I want to talk about it with him since I don't feel like I have anyone else to talk to but he told me about how good his day way &amp; how positive he's feeling and I really really don't want to ruin that for him. It makes me really happy that his day was so good &amp; he deserves to sit in that positivity. I don't want him to have to comfort me or feel bad for me, but it's just hard not telling anyone. So here I am, using reddit as a way to get it out of my system. I try so hard to find ways to feel good and stay hopeful when I feel myself getting into that's his negative state of mind but it's just so hard when the work I put into it comes up with very small results. I just wish I could sink into the floor for a month or so then come back up when things start feeling more lighthearted.",2

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. 

After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. 

Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. 

After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. 
We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.

After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew. 


Tl;DR: Went to a party,  tipsy --&gt; fun, drunk --&gt; told all my secrets/insecurities to a girl. 

Made out/cuddled with her the whole night. 

Woke up --&gt; got depressed/antisocial/sober.

train_pid_293,"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",1

train_pid_3466,"Struggling : Hey everyone.

It's the New Year, and like a lot of people around here I'm really struggling. If everything goes well, I'll have 3 years sober. I guess without the alcohol and the drugs I'm just left with myself, and that is the problem.

Without the drugs and alcohol I just cannot seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March. 

Thanks for reading. I don't expect people to really care, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

train_pid_1631,"Back to reality after new year's : I had to spend the holidays with my family and their friends, and even though I don't like social situations and it's really overwhelming for me, it was nice to (at least somewhat) escape my parents. But it was hard for me to see that my cousins have a much better life in general: they live in a nice huge flat, are richer, and have a great relationship with their parents overall. And I envy them so much. 

I tried to spend as much time with their family as possible, and they were really nice to me, seemed interested about my hobbies and school, and gave me really nice christmas gifts (even though I'm not much of a fan of designer clothes, a Levi's hoodie is awesome and it's definitely the most expensive piece of clothing I own and I'm really thankful for it). 

But now I have to go back to our small flat full of things my mum was too lazy to throw out, to my lonely life with no friends, no one who cares about me. To my mum, who gets angry at me for the smallest things and never says anything nice to me, to my stepfather, who's a smoker and an alcoholic, who often shouts at me, who I'm always scared will rape me at some point of my life (I'm probably just paranoid, but I fucking hate him). 

Both wouldn't care if I told them how I feel. Both would kill me if they knew that the only time I feel somewhat happy is when I get drunk with my classmates, because ""smoking and drinking is fine when you are an adult and cause it's legal, but underage drinking or doing illegal drugs makes you a degenerate who doesn't deserve to be treated like a human being"", but that's a different story. 

I always feel like I'm just a spoiled brat and an angsty teenager, that my life is actually really good and I'm just ungrateful. But the truth is, that I've felt much happier and more accepted with the people I see maybe every other month at best than I've ever felt with my parents.",1
train_pid_6515,"What are you thankful for? : Depression has a way of casting gloom over everything, stripping out the colors and turning the world grey. We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were. I’m hoping that 2020 can somehow bring more peace to my life than 2019 did, and I’m thankful for that chance.",0
train_pid_7373,"Loud Noises : I feel like for the first 22 years of my life I was sitting in the back seat of a car that I had set to autopilot. Someone times my car ran out of fuel and I felt stranded and I had people around me offer rides. Those were probably the best times of my life. Sitting shotgun in someone else’s car while they drove was so nice, but I feel like while I was in other people’s cars there was so much noise that no one could hear me. So, I stopped trying to listen. I stopped trying. 
Its hard to hear through the noise of life but occasionally I hear brief calls from whoever’s car I am in at the time. Those noises are scary because they are unfamiliar. Often when I hear one of those noises, I'd jump out of the car that I was in. I think I have been jumping out of other people’s cars so often I don’t even know where my own car is anymore. 
Now when people ask me to get into their cars, I can barely hear them anymore. The noises of life have gotten too much. All I want is to get into someone’s car and have them take me to mine. But I don’t even know how to make my own voice heard anymore. Now, whenever someone stops to let me in and ask me where I am going, the only way I know how to have my voice be heard is to shout over the noises of life. And when I shout at someone trying to help me, they drive away. Or maybe I run away. Why are the noises so loud?",0
train_pid_2058,"Loosing my dad and it's probably going to cost me my job. : I've been struggling with depression for a long time. Since I was a teen and I'm now in my late twenties.

I never had it as severe as those around me and I'm typically able to function well enough to get by day by day. 2019 however has been really rough for me. At the beginning of the year my engagement broke off and subsequent events compounded on it.

I had started to bounce back by finding a creative outlet in writing and was so excited to make 2020 my year. Then my dad got sick. He's older and has had compilations but when I saw him on Christmas it was like he didn't even know I was there. He couldn't speak or walk on his own, I had saw him the week before and he was fully functional. It really threw me off.

Then I heard he was admitted to the hospital. He had a seizure and possibly a stroke. They had found traces of bleeding in his brain and... I'm trying to be optimistic but something inside me is absolutely lurching with dredd. 

I can't get my mind off it. I keep getting so anxious out of nowhere. I'll space out and find myself staring at the wall an hour later. Today is the second day I've called of work in a row. My managers seem understanding and kind but there's only so much sympathy an employer can afford to give. But I just can't bring myself to go there. It's not even a hard job, I like my job.

I'm normally so emotionally shut off from big events that should affect me. To the point where I sometimes feel like a monster because I can feel the emotions that I know I should. This year though has been so taxing and everything is in overdrive. Even if my dad comes home I doubt he'll be the same person I saw weeks ago.

I'm having a really hard time holding together here.",1

train_pid_5127,"If you don’t want to read this, you don’t have to. I’m just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet. : You know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis? Well I’m basically doing the same thing but posting in on a website in which I don’t know anybody. This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

Spending time with people annoys me, I don’t find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven’t left the house or showered for a week because I haven’t needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.


I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn’t want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.


I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t talk to anyone about this and I have extremely bad experiences with doctors when I’ve tried to go to them about my anxiety. I just hope I’m not broken forever.",1

train_pid_2582,"My brother passed on Monday morning : Hello, I’m writing this because I don’t know how to cope with this and I don’t know what to do. My brother was a year older than me. We are half brothers. He was fighting with addiction all of 2018. He got clean with the help of our mom and enlisted in the military to try and change his life. He succeeded. He graduated basic and was stationed in Georgia. He was so excited to start traveling the world. He came back last week to our home town to see me, his girlfriend, his son, and our grandma. Well when he was in town he wanted to try it again. He wanted to feel the high as he hasn’t in so long. So he got some Fentanyl pills. He overdosed before Christmas and got rushed to a hospital with his girlfriend. He was saved with Narcan. He told me he took too many OxyContin and thats what caused it. If only I wasn’t so blind. He then overdosed again this last Saturday. I didn’t know about this, but he was revived again. On Sunday he wanted to spend some time with his son, so he stayed at my grandmas house with him. We were supposed to go to the local zoo on Monday.. made plans to spend New Years together before he headed back to Georgia. 

My brother overdosed again on Sunday. We weren’t there to save him this time. Monday morning his son found my brother, his father, slumped and bleeding. My brother was gone. We are planning the funeral now, but it doesn’t feel real to me. I rushed over to my grandmas to see him. I had to see him. Even with that image in my head, I can’t believe it. I don’t know how to process this. I cried when everyone celebrated the new year. This was supposed to be his year. He was just supposed to visit. I don’t know what to do. 

One of my questions is, did he die in piece? Did he feel any pain? I feel like if I knew the answer I could breathe a moment. I want to know what he felt. If he was in pain while going, I know I’ll be a wreck. I know he did not intend to overdose, but it happened and it’s left his family broken. If anyone can help me, please.",1

train_pid_7127,"[Resident Physician] Horribly depressed, months after failing to match for residency :  I knew I wanted to be an ER doctor early on in med school. Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. My application, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec (called SLOEs in the EM world) were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Was there some hidden red flag on my application? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I match on March 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.

So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing and I'm fairly sure I would off myself if I had to work as an IM or FM doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life.

I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I've always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how I feel. Pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out (which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects). But I'm convinced that if I fail to match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. For one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there's little chance you'll be competitive for \*any\* residency if you try to match again the next year. There just won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any decent field outside of medicine would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged on March 16, 2020 at 11 AM EST, and if I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.

If not...these remaining two months will be my last.",0

train_pid_5269,"Loosing my dad and it's probably going to cost me my job. : I've been struggling with depression for a long time. Since I was a teen and I'm now in my late twenties.

I never had it as severe as those around me and I'm typically able to function well enough to get by day by day. 2019 however has been really rough for me. At the beginning of the year my engagement broke off and subsequent events compounded on it.

I had started to bounce back by finding a creative outlet in writing and was so excited to make 2020 my year. Then my dad got sick. He's older and has had compilations but when I saw him on Christmas it was like he didn't even know I was there. He couldn't speak or walk on his own, I had saw him the week before and he was fully functional. It really threw me off.

Then I heard he was admitted to the hospital. He had a seizure and possibly a stroke. They had found traces of bleeding in his brain and... I'm trying to be optimistic but something inside me is absolutely lurching with dredd. 

I can't get my mind off it. I keep getting so anxious out of nowhere. I'll space out and find myself staring at the wall an hour later. Today is the second day I've called of work in a row. My managers seem understanding and kind but there's only so much sympathy an employer can afford to give. But I just can't bring myself to go there. It's not even a hard job, I like my job.

I'm normally so emotionally shut off from big events that should affect me. To the point where I sometimes feel like a monster because I can feel the emotions that I know I should. This year though has been so taxing and everything is in overdrive. Even if my dad comes home I doubt he'll be the same person I saw weeks ago.

I'm having a really hard time holding together here.",1

I can't recall a time where I was normatively happy on a daily basis. I drank until I blacked out two nights in a row on Friday and Saturday night. I need to take a couple pills of Benadryl to even go to sleep. I think my time will come to an end soon; there's no other way out of this hole. There's a strange comfort in knowing that I can end it all so soon, and never feel this way, or any way, ever again. Maybe I'll disappoint my family and friends, but  I've already disappointed myself on so many occasions, it doesn't matter any more. I can barely look at myself in the mirror, I hang my head when I walk to an from classes, I'm invisible to everyone and myself. Life is just one giant distraction from the inevitable of which is our end--our death. I'm peering over the cliff's edge, and all I see is darkness, an abyss.

train_pid_907,"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.

I’ve never posted before but this subreddit makes me feel some sort of comfort that I’m not alone in this. Thanks if you made it this far.

I’m literally on my last leg...I fucked up my relationship with the man and I love which ruined New Year’s Eve and, this past day I’ve been so depressed and sick to my stomach yet I just wanted to drink again WHY DO I ALWAYS NEED A DRUG TO SUPPRESS MY NATURAL STATE WHY AM I FUCKED UP LIKE THIS I STG I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ENDING IT IDK WHY IVE BEEN CURSED WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN MY FMILY IS NORMAL. I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",2

I’ve deleted all forms of social media, besides Reddit. It helped in some ways, especially initially, but now it’s just another thing I’m depressed about — I deleted all of those digital human connections. 

Sometimes it feels like there’s no winning. No matter what, the situation depresses me. It’s either too hot or too cold, too much or too little. I take action to change, then spend years lamenting what I’ve lost, while hating what I’ve gained.

Today was probably one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was really looking forward to hanging out and partying with my friends for new years but idk they didnt want to party they wanted to play playstation which is fine I guess but idk we're in our 20s it's new years eve we always used to party but idk so basically I ended up spending it by myself and on top of that I got some weed thinking that would definetly make it better but got either the worst mid ever or some straight cbd bud idk its trash though I know that for sure, but idk for some reason after today and how it went like it just pushed to the point of that's it like I'm done with these people and I wont talk to them anymore, I'm starting all the way over and I'll try to make new friends or whatever, I deleted all my social media theres literally no way for anyone besides my family which is my grandma mom and 2 brothers to contact me. Ive just had a shitty day, but theres a backstory to it, I've always been not necessarily depressed but I usually feel kind of a mix of down and lonely extremely lonely for sure. Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",1

New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things.

train_pid_1269,"I don't pray : I grew up in a very christian household, we had good times for a while but then when it got bad it got bad. There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.

train_pid_1865,"Help : Hi every one I need some help I'm 18 for the past month I've had no drive apart from working my dead end job and drinking myself to death at the weekends, I had a bad experience with a girl 2 years ago and although it doesn't bother me anymore I don't get feelings for anyone or excited for anything since I spend all days in my bed thinking non stop.

I go to my gym which helps while I'm out there but as soon as I come in my mind goes to shit.

I feel like I'm losing my mind or I'm dying and I dunno what to do I have no drive or feelings for anyone or anything I've had plenty of sexual experiences but felt nothing for any of them what do I do from here in the new year to improve my life?",1
train_pid_366,"Happy New year's me. : Idk why I'm posting but my head is too foggy to think straight. My dad passed away yesterday and I don't know how to feel. We weren't the closest but I loved him so much and he gave me so many amazing memories. I'm at a hotel for new years currently and still am and idk how any of this is going to affect me when I get home. 

This will probably get lost in new but I don't see this really helping me either.",1

Even if it doesn't seems to look up, it will get better and you will always have friends among this great people here. Happy new Years everyone!",0
train_pid_1771,"NYE :  When I say it's just one more lap around the sun, I do this to minimise how I can't breathe when thinking about another year. 
When friends invite me out, I will say I'm busy, when I'm not and I actually would love to go out, but I end up isolating myself. 
I'll stay at home to feel safe, whilst having panic attacks and crying into my pillow.
I'll plan all the things I can do and watch, when really it's background noise for the lonely and envious thoughts playing on loop while I stare at the ceiling.
I'll send heartfelt wishes and motivational messages to all my loved ones, while thinking about how long it'll be until I finally kill myself this year.

I don't want the people I love to know how I feel, because it'd just ruin their fun. I'm only in the business of self destruction.",1

train_pid_2986,"I’m just having a hard time : Tl;dr I’m just having a hard time, and I know it will pass but it hasn’t yet and it sucks. 

I don’t know why I’m here, I’m usually not one to show any emotion, or ask for help, I’ve always been mild and even tempered. Lately I’ve really been struggling though, I deleted my social media’s weeks ago, due to negative interactions, before that I ditched long running games I’d played on my phone, the idea behind that was so that I could focus more time on my family without distractions. I had a drastic shift change at work and I knew time with them was going to be at a premium already and I didn’t want meaningless things taking away from them. My wife struggles with her own anxiety and depression, I don’t want to lump mine on to hers when I don’t full understand it myself, even though to a certain degree I already do, I removed familiar comfort distractions and I never replaced them with constructive creative outlets like I intended. I cut out the empty but never replaced it with anything meaningful, the things that distracted me from the monotony are gone, but all I have right now is the monotonous day in day out. I know my wife sees it, she’s called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I’m tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained. More than anything I think I just needed to say this, if only to try and shake myself out of apathy.",1
train_pid_701,"Am I depressed or is this just a rough patch(vent) : This is probably going to sound stupid but I don’t know if I should seek help because of how i’ve been feeling lately or if this is just a rough time and it’ll get better over time. Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at. I didn’t mean to make this post THAT long but I just don’t know what I should do. Should I seek help? Or will everything get better over time ....",1

train_pid_3829,"Please please please : ive never posted anything before bc im a coward who's really bad at using words, but i really wanna vent and be heard.

today was the first day of school. i got home at 2pm and i planned to study for tmr's lesson but its already 11pm and i havent opened a single book. all i did was use my phone. im supposed to sleep now too bc i have to wake up early tomorrow. 

 god i really just wish for death. i don't care about the future anymore. i don't care about making fun memories, i don't care about getting new experiences,i don't care about missing all the things im looking forward to. i am of no good use, i am nothing. it hasn't even been the first 24 hours of 2020 and im already like this. i have no ambition, i have no future, i am a waste of my parents money. and i cant talk about my depression to my family, they'll tell me that god will be furious, and ill be in hell for being ungrateful of the life im given. but its not like i want help bc i dont want to continue living anymore.

every night i desperately pray that i die in my sleep so i dont have to wake up to see the next morning. whenever i cross the road to get to school, i hope a car crashes into me.

tonight too i pray that i dont wake up tmr while i cry alone in bed in the dark. i really really just wish i dont live anymore",1

Living is exhausting and to be honest I wish I was never born, I’ve never been truly happy. I’ve been lying to myself coping with my problems in different ways and I’m tired of it all. I think I’m done with this..",1
